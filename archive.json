Leave it at that.  This opens the door for optional support of additional syntaxes without explicitly stating it.\n\nSHOULD is strong enough that an implementor should think twice before deciding against the requirement, but allows them to still claim compliance if they choose not to.\n\nIf you want to take it further, the spec could state that the default behavior of the implementation MUST be per spec, but it could have an option or switch that enables extended support.\n\n> My concern with a more permissive approach would be the difficulty of testing that for compliance.\n\nJSON Schema is quite permissive and has a very extensive test suite.  Test what the spec requires. Maybe have optional tests for common permissive cases, or let implementations independently test their optional support.",

In JMESPath, `@.bar` would be equivalent to just `bar`, and `@[0]` would be equivalent to just `[0]`. The current node symbol `@` is, according to the specification, \"only allowed when it's used in a bare expression\", i.e. in contexts such as \r\n```\r\n@ == `[1,2]`\r\n```     \r\nor\r\n```\r\ncount(@)\r\n```\r\n(However, I think the grammar does allow `@.bar` in addition to `bar`).\r\n\r\n> As a result, they can't do something like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> $.foo[?(@.bar == $.baz)]\r\n> ```\r\nThere were proposals to introduce lexical scoping in JMESPath, see [James James Saryerwinnie's original proposal](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.site/blob/ae5ad3f590ae92c9789f3e5cacd99726ea028b74/docs/proposals/let-function.rst) and [Michael Dowling's sugestion](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.site/pull/6#issuecomment-91977719). These proposals would e.g. support binding the value of `baz` at the start of evaluation (equivalent to `$.baz`) to a variable named `foo`,  and thus support something like `bar == $foo`, where the variable `foo` is referenced using `$foo` notation. These proposals never made it into the JMESPath specification, though.\r\n\r\nSome implementations of JMESPath extend the syntax to support the `$` symbol to refer to the root, and allow `bar == $.baz`.\r\n\r\nSee also [\\#76](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/76), which compares the meaning of \"current node\" in JSONPath, JMESPath, and XPath 3.1.\r\n\r\n ",

This issue has been created to define all of the things that we expect JSON Path should be able to do.\r\n\r\n### **\\<NOTE>**\r\n*In the second comment, I reconsider the interpretation I post in the this first comment.  However, I'm leaving it here for posterity as it does contain some interesting ideas.*\r\n### **\\</NOTE>**\r\n\r\n## Basic Operations\r\n\r\n`$` - Selects the root of the instance.  MUST be used at the start of the path; MAY be used in expressions as a reference.\r\n`.<name>` - If the value is an object selects the value in the property indicated by `<name>`, if it exists; otherwise an empty array.\r\n`.*` - If the value is an object, selects the values of all properties; otherwise an empty array.\r\n`[<index>]` - If the value is an array, selects the values at the positions indicated by `<index>`.  (See array indices later.)\r\n`[*]` - If the value is an array, selects all of the values in it; otherwise an empty array.\r\n\r\nThis is where I start to have issues with the way that Goessner defined things.  There is an incongruity between the syntax and the operation of the \\*-syntax and the name-syntax of the property selector and the recursive selector.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, `.prop` would select the value under the `prop` property of a local object.  Similiarly, `..prop` would find all objects recursively and select the values under their `prop` properties.  These seem to behave the same, and this makes sense as they have similar syntaxes.\r\n\r\nBut the \\*-syntax selectors *don't* behave the same, even though they look like they should.  `.*` will select all values of all properties *if the local value is an object*.  `..*` on the other hand recursively selects *all values* including the local value (consensus says most do, some only select children) and values inside both objects and arrays.  It seems like the logical behavior for `..*` should be to recursively find values of object properties.\r\n\r\nBut this leaves a gap: how do we define the \"recursive get everything\"?  Furthermore, do we need a \"local get everything\" that would return the current item and array items (if an array) or object values (if an object)?\r\n\r\nThat confusion aside, defining `..*` this way opens the door for another syntax: `.[*]`, which would recursively select all values in arrays.  In essence, it defines the recursion operator merely as a `.` followed by another operator.  This means that if we want the \"select all\" behavior, we can define a new operator (and character) for it.\r\n\r\n## Selecting Everything\r\n\r\nFor now, suppose we use `~`.  This gives these selectors as well:\r\n\r\n- `.~` - Selects the current value (maybe) and its local decendents, whether they are property values or array items.\r\n- `..~` - Selects the current value (maybe) and its recursive decentents.\r\n\r\n### Does `~` select the current node?\r\n\r\nConsider the example currently in the spec:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"a\": [\r\n    {\"b\": 1},\r\n    {\"b\": 2},\r\n    {\"b\": 3},\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf our path is `$.~`, then we have two options.  If we return the local value (the root), then we also include the intermediate values, like the array and all of the objects in it.  If we don't return the local value and only return the children values, then we must apply the same logic at every step so that the result is only the leaf values: `[1, 2, 3]`.\r\n\r\nThe consensus report shows that most implementations return the intermediate values, therefore, they should also return the local value.\r\n\r\n## Array Indices\r\n\r\nThe array selector supports a number of index forms\r\n\r\n- direct index lists\r\n- index calculations\r\n- predicate selections\r\n\r\nThe consensus shows that not only are single selections (as in Goessner's post) generally supported, but comma-delimited lists of indices are allowed.  (Goessner does have a single example with multiple indices: `$..book[0,1]`)  And many also support mixing the various styles.\r\n\r\n### Direct index lists\r\n\r\nEach item can be a single index or a [slice-notation index range](https://stackoverflow.com/a/509295/878701) (couldn't find a spec on it, but this SO answer is pretty thorough, even if it's for python).\r\n\r\n### Index calculations\r\n\r\nThis index is an expression that evaluates to a valid index, surrounded by parentheses.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear if Goessner's intent was to have the expression only evaluate to a single value, but we *could* support it evaluating to a collection or slice-notation.\r\n\r\n### Predicate selections\r\n\r\nThis index is also an expression, except that it evaluates to a boolean result.  The expression iterates over all of the items and returns `true` for items to include and `false` for those to exclude.  Like the other expression, this is surrounded by parentheses, however in this case the parentheses are preceded by a `?`.\r\n\r\n### Expression syntax\r\n\r\nExpressions bring us to the last selector, `@`.  This selector is context sensitive: it carries a slightly different meaning depending on which type of index it's in.\r\n\r\nFor index calculation expressions, this symbol represents the array itself.  It can be used in the expression to obtain information about the array, as in Goessner's example `$..book[(@.length-1)]`.\r\n\r\nFor predecate selection expressions, this symbol represents the current item as the selection iterates over the contents of the array.\r\n\r\nThere are some other details about the expression syntax that would probably be better [discussed in another issue](https://github.com/jsonpath-standard/internet-draft/issues/17).",

The difference here is that we've defined `*` universally as \"select all children of the local value regardless of the local value's type\" rather than making a distinction between the object or array syntax.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of this interpretation is that `[*]` covers the string-index format for property selection, e.g. `['name']`, without the need for additional clarification in the spec.\r\n\r\nNote that there isn't an array analog for `..name`.

Gr\u00fc\u00dfe, Carsten\r\n\r\nNo, but I can certainly see how you could have interpreted it that way! By match I meant a match for the expression \"$.a.b.c\", but worded that poorly. In this case the collection would be empty until evaluating the tail of the path \".c\", if it got that far.\r\n\r\nBut to my point, consider the [store example](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html#e3) with path `$..isbn`. In this case `.isbn` will be applied four times, at the tail end of four paths. In two cases with match, an isbn will be added to the collection, in the two others with no match, nothing will be added to the collection.  In the latter cases, I don't think it can be said that the selector got an empty array, rather, it did nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Given\r\n```\r\n{\"key-dash\": \"value\"}\r\n```\r\nthe selector\r\n```\r\n$.key-dash\r\n```\r\nresults in\r\n```\r\n[\"value\"]\r\n```\r\nfor about half of the implementations. This includes the important Jayway and Goessner implementations. \r\n\r\nHowever, Jayway and Goessner part company when it comes to filter expressions. Given\r\n```\r\n[{\"key-dash\": \"value\"}]\r\n```\r\nthe selector\r\n```\r\n$[*][?(@.key-dash == 'value')]\r\n```\r\nin Jayway, results in\r\n```\r\n[{\"key-dash\" : \"value\"}]\r\n```\r\nand, in Goessner, in\r\n```\r\njsonPath: dash is not defined: _v.key-dash == 'value'\r\n```\r\nWhen a JavaScript interpreter is involved, the rules for identifiers _are_ the rules of JavaScript, similarly for other interpreters.  \r\n\r\nFollowing up on a point raised earlier by [gregsdennis](https://github.com/gregsdennis), implementations that follow Jayway don't support the `length` property on arrays, they don't support\r\n```\r\n$..book[(@.length-1)]\r\n```\r\nbut instead support a length function at the tail end of the path,\r\n```\r\n$..book[(@.length()-1)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in any case, with unquoted names with dashes and subtraction, the user will need to know to leave a space before the minus sign.\r\n\r\nMy tentative conclusions are:\r\n\r\n- Given the popularity of names with dashes, and the broad support for unquoted names with dashes in legacy implementations, it would be difficult to exclude them in the draft.\r\n- Implementations that employ a scripting language for evaluating expressions _must_ follow the rules for that scripting language, even if inconsistent with the name requirements in the primary path.\r\n- There's a limit to how much the draft can say about expressions. Implementations diverge, depending on whether they're using a scripting language, or a custom evaluator. In the former case, users may have to live with inconsistency in naming requirements, and in the latter case, with having to include a space before a minus sign.\r\n ",

      "body": "In his post, Goessner indicates that for `[(...)]` (\"container query\") and `[?(...)]` (\"item query\"), the contained expression should use \"the underlying script engine.\"\r\n\r\nThis presents a problem for consistency and interoperability between systems.  A JSON Path written with a Javascript expression won't work when evaluated using an implementation written in PHP or .Net.\r\n\r\nTo address this, we should either define that the scripting language is something well-known (e.g. ECMAScript 2015 or C), or we should define our own language (a domain-specific language, or DSL).\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nI like the idea of a simple DSL, and this proposal outlines the rules around such a language.\r\n\r\n### Exploring the data with `@`\r\n\r\nJSON elements can be explored using JSON Path within the expression, and the values that are returned can be compared using simple comparison operators.\r\n\r\nThis alone enables expressions like `?(@.price<10)` and `?(@.isbn)`.  These state \"the path `@.price` returns a value and that value is less than 10,\" and \"the path `@.isbn` returns a value,\" respectively.  And because these are just JSON Paths, implementations will already have the parsing logic for them.  Further, it means that indexer syntax for property names will work, so that `?(@['price']<10)` and `?(@['isbn'])` will also work.\r\n\r\n### Operators\r\n\r\nThe basic comparison, mathematical, and boolean operators should be sufficient, at least for the initial revision of the specification.  I expect most programmers will be familiar with the C-style operators, so I propose we use those.\r\n\r\n```\r\n==   equal\r\n!=   not equal\r\n<    less than\r\n<=   less than or equal to\r\n>    greater than\r\n>=   greater than or equal to\r\n\r\n+    addition\r\n-    subtraction\r\n*    multiplication\r\n/    division\r\n%    modulus\r\n\r\n&&   and\r\n||   or\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm open to alternatives, but this gives us a good grounding.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can just use single `=`, `&`, and `|` instead of the doubles?  That might open up a `^` for an XOR or a `!&` for a NAND.  (`!|` for NOR is going to be fun to read.)\r\n\r\n### Reserved words\r\n\r\nI'd also like to propose that we define a number of reserved properties, like `length`.  This enables functionality like in the container query syntax example `(@.length-1)`.  If the user wants to reference an object property named `length`, they would need to specifically use the indexer syntax `(@['length'] - 1)` which would fetch the value from the `length` property of an object, subtract one, and return the result.\r\n\r\nAdditional reserved words that we may need are open for proposal/discussion.\r\n\r\nOpen question: Does this enable these reserved keywords outside of the context of a query expression, i.e. does `$.length` give the number of child items of the root value?\r\n\r\n### Backtracking?\r\n\r\nThere aren't any examples in Goessner's post, but it might be desirable to navigate up the JSON structure to fetch a value to be used in an expression.\r\n\r\nFor example (with Goessner's example data), suppose I wanted to find the books which cost less than the bike.  There isn't a way to get from iterating over the `book` array to _outside of_ the `book` array where the `bicycle` is.\r\n\r\nAlernatively, I *could* use the root operator `$` to start from the beginning within the expression and do something like `$..book[@.price<$..bicycle.price]`, so maybe this isn't explicitly needed for now.\r\n\r\n### Restrictions\r\n\r\nFor these cases, I think it makes sense to require that these internal paths MUST only return a single value.  Returning multiple values should remain an explicitly undefined behavior (allows the implementation to decide how to handle it).  (However doing something like `?(@..price.length>4)` to get \"are there more than 4 objects that contain a `price` property?\" does make sense.  The full path still just returns a single value, even though the `@..price` portion returns multiple.)\r\n",

However `@.phoneNumbers[*].type` actually returns multiple values, and we want to ensure that one of those values is `\"iPhone\"`.\r\n\r\nTo that end, alongside `.length`, I would like to propose another reserved word: `.contains`.  The kicker here is that we want to pass a parameter (the value to check for), so we need a parameter list: `.contains(\"iPhone\")`.  This, then, returns a boolean value, just like the `==` operator.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nExtending this, it may make sense to have _all_ reserved words carry a parameter list, even if that list is empty.  For example, `.length()`.  This would leave the door open for `.length` to refer to a property named \"length\" instead.\r\n\r\n(It looks like the [Java implementation](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) does this.)",

This raises the question of whether (and if so, how) the resulting collection of nodes needs to be distinct, i.e. without duplicates.\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJSON instance:\r\n{\r\n  \"a\": [\r\n    \"string\",\r\n    null,\r\n    true\r\n  ],\r\n  \"b\": [\r\n    false,\r\n    \"string\",\r\n    5.4\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n\r\nPath:\r\n$.*[0,1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe raw result set of this selector is `[\"string\", null, false, \"string\"]`.  If we say that we expect only the distinct set of nodes, then the results would be `[\"string\", null, false]`, removing the duplicate `\"string\"`.\r\n\r\nSo the question up for discussion is, \"Should selectors return distinct sets of nodes or are duplicates preferred?\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI had been considering a location-based distinction (based on the location of the value in the original JSON structure) as a possibility, but I don't think it makes much sense given the definition of a selector in Section 2.5, taking multiple nodes and outputing multiple nodes.  A selector knows nothing about the original JSON structure that is being evaluated.\r\n\r\nHowever for posterity, consider the following (rather contrived) path evaluated against the above instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$.*[0,:5]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the `\"string\"` value which is the first element of the `a` property would be selected twice, and the `\"string\"` value in the second element of the `b` property would be selected once, resulting in three `\"string\"` values in the results.  For location-based distinction, only the value from `a` would be considered duplicate, leaving two instances of `\"string\"` in the result set.\r\n\r\nAgain, I *don't* think that this is a viable approach due to how a selector works and the information it's given.  However, if we were to also require [location as part of the output](https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/issues/29), then this *would* be a viable solution.",

Any processing on further path segments will result in the same output.  Therefore we should only need to perform further selection once on these values.\r\n\r\nDuplicate removal resolves this problem.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEven when we include locations, this can be used as an internal optimization.

Such addressing information could be in the form of normalized paths, or it could be provided by references or pointers into the original data, in languages that support that. In either case, the issue is the same.\r\n\r\nSo suppose that a user queries for a collection of prices for all books in the store, and wishes to discount them all by twenty percent. If duplicates come back, if the same price gets marked down twice, that's going to be a problem. This is not entirely hypothetical, there are jsonpath libraries that are used in this way.\r\n\r\nMore generally, it's hard to think of use cases where duplicates would be beneficial. It's possible to think of use cases where they would be detrimental. For an implementation that collects normalized paths along with values, removal is easy. Of course, removal comes with a cost, and some users may prefer not to pay that cost, particularly as most straightforward queries don't result in duplicates anyway. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This does relate directly to whether we remove duplicates in that if we define that sequence matters _and_ duplicates are removed, which copies of duplicated values are kept?\r\n\r\nBefore we can answer that, I think we need to define whether the sequence of the results matter.  This has implications for users of the Compliance Test Suite (CTS) as that it lists the expected results.\r\n\r\nIf we decide that output sequence is important, then an implementation using the CTS would need to ensure that the actual result (from the implementation) and the expected result (from the CTS) must be sequence-equal.  This is fairly straightforward and easy to process.\r\n\r\nHowever if we decide that output sequence does _not_ matter, implementations would need to check for contents-equal.  This is more complex to implement (but not impossible).\r\n\r\nOnce we have defined this, we can go back to #23 and address whether to remove duplicates and, if so, which duplicates to remove.",

The issue with using JSONPath is that it's a query syntax, and while it _can_ isolate a single value, it's not specifically designed to.\r\n\r\n[JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901#section-7) (2013), however, _was_ designed to isolate a single value within a JSON structure.

Our client is the consuming application, and requiring them to expect one of potentially multiple output formats is not ideal.  An implementation is free to go above and beyond the specification and support both, but we definitely shouldn't:\r\n\r\n- _require_ support of both or\r\n- give the option to support either\r\n\r\nas this adds burden to the consuming application.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> @cabo - interpreting a JSON Pointer needs to have the JSON value around...\r\n\r\nThis is true for whichever location identifier syntax we choose.  Remember, this is in the output result of a JSONPath evaluating _an instance_.  Without the instance, the location loses all context, and whether a `0` represents an integer index or a string property name becomes moot.  You _always_ need the instance to intepret the location, whether it's expressed in JSON Pointer or JSONPath.\r\n\r\n> @mkmik - and we don't want this JSONPath $.a[0] to also locate \"x\" in both documents (that is, we don't want\r\nJSONPath to stringify the 0 numeric literal into a \"0\" string literal, if applied to an object)?\r\n\r\nAs above, this location identifier is intrinsicly linked to the instance that was evaluated.\r\n\r\nWhen a JSONPath is evaluated against instance **A**, it produces a set of location identifiers that are specific to that evaluation.  If we then evaluate the same path against instance **B**, a different set of location identifiers are produced.  The location identifiers produced by the evaluation of **A** are not relevant at all to **B**.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make sense to talk about a numeric segment being interpreted an index or a key with different instances because the location identifier that contains that segment is tied to the instance that produced it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo ultimately the choice comes down to the following:\r\n\r\n- Using JSONPath as the location identifier means that the logic to evaluate it is the same as the logic which produced it (which is convenient).  However evaluating the location identifier against the instance produces a single-value array, which _suggests_ that multiple values _could_ result.  (It also feels odd that this evaluation of the output path against the instance again produces the output path.)\r\n- Using JSON Pointer is more semantically appropriate since it only produces a single value.  However it does require support of another syntax (though that support will ideally be provided by a separate implementation, of which there are many in multiple languages).\r\n\r\n> @mkmik - But the specification could choose JSONPointer as the clearest means to an end: showing what it means to produce a result that points to values in the input document.\r\n\r\n\u261d\ufe0f sounds like a vote for JSON Pointer to me.

      "body": "After a longer abstinence from JSONPath, I decided to jump in again and contribute to the design of the internet draft. First, I am much impressed by the work already done here, at Christoph Burgmer's great test suite and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOver all the years I liked and still do like JSON's redundancy free minimalistic approach. Let's try to design JSONPath in a similar way.\r\n\r\nThis first input is more an overview of things that catch my eye, while reading through the draft. Points to discuss should go into already existing or new separate issues then ... \r\n\r\n### Normative vs. Informative\r\n\r\nI consider chapters 1.1 - 1.2 and 3. as normative (possibly with some informative parts) and important. The rest is informative or currently not written. Maybe that should better be mixed in or go to an example section as in JSON RFC 7159.\r\n\r\n### Terminology\r\n\r\nTerminology is essential. I started a table comparing terms used in  JSONPath, XPath, CSS Selectors and JSON Pointer.\r\n\r\n#### Table 1: Terminology compared\r\n\r\n|  | JSONPath | XPath | CSS Selectors| JSON Pointer  |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |\r\n| What is it? | string syntax for identifying values within a JSON document | a language for addressing parts of an XML document | patterns that match against elements in a tree  | string syntax for identifying a specific value within a JSON document \r\n| primary purpose |  `selection`,<br>`addressing`  | `selection`,<br>`addressing`,<br>`matching`,<br>`manipulating` | `matching` |`identifying` |\r\n| document root |  `JSON value`,<br>`JSON structure`,<br>`input document`,<br>`root node`  | `context node` | `document root` | `root value` |\r\n| models root as ... |  tree of nodes  | tree of nodes | tree of elements | JSON document? |\r\n| primary syntactic construct | `JSONPath`,<br>`expression`,<br>`selector`,<br>`query` | `expression`,<br>`location path` | `selector` | `JSON Pointer` |\r\n| minimal selector unit | `selector` | `location step` | `simple selector` | `reference token` |\r\n| minimal target | `node`,<br>`value` | `node`,<br>`value` | `element` |  `referenced value` |\r\n| expression evaluates to | `list of nodes` | `node-set` | `elements` | `JSON value` |\r\n| what to do on errors | return empty node list ? | errors specified ... but no according behavior  | rule using selector is dropped | not defined by specification |\r\n\r\nI see this as a living table, which is editable and able to grow over time. I think, we should try to agree on few essential terms.\r\n\r\nChapters 1.1 and 3.2 deal with Terminology. Maybe we could merge them.\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\nWhen reading through issues and mailing list here, sometimes something came to my mind, which I want to add here as a remark.\r\n\r\n* JSONPath was originally meant for pure selection, with \"the right tool for the right job\" in mind. Transformation or analysis of the resulting node list should be done by corresponding other tools taking as input the node-list as normalized path expressions. So no functions on the final node-set are necessary.\r\n\r\n* I like the formal concept, where each selection step gets a node-list as input and produces a possibly empty node-list as output.\r\n\r\n* Simple JSONPath expressions ideally could be evaluated by pure Javascript `eval` function (letting security aside) originally. So the dot child selector would expect names according to syntax rules for JavaScript variables only, so allowing `'_'` but no `'-'` characters. We can relax this rule here, but I think, that *variable syntax rule* is easy to learn and remember. Otherwise we can always use the bracket-notation.\r\n\r\n* I was adding the union selector simply because XPath had one.\r\n\r\n* Script expressions `?(...)` and `(...)` were meant as a hack in my original implementation and documentation. And thus a security nightmare of course. But leaving the term `script` aside, similar subexpression are supported by XPath and CSS selectors &ndash; kind of salt in the soup. By the way, I like [David Chester's approach](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath#differences-from-original-implementation) of evaluating script expressions. Discussion is needed here for sure.\r\n\r\n* A minor thing is: Duplicates are removed by XPath. JSONPath won't by its original philosophy, as it simply doesn't analyse and modify results.\r\n\r\nI will raise more individual issues in future and/or contribute to existing ones.\r\n\r\nIf there are already solutions / agreements, which I am not aware of, I apologize.\r\n\r\n---\r\nthanks\r\n",

      "body": "Hello List,\r\n\r\nIt has been important to go through this list threads carefully. In fact I should have done that at first. Now I can understand the current draft and appreciate the work already done much better.\r\n\r\nI collected some citations (important from my point of view) with comments already in Markdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Title of the specification\r\n\r\n> JSONPath: A query language for JSON data.\r\n*(Carsten Bormann)*\r\n\r\n> I think I\u2019d slightly prefer the term \u201csyntax\u201d to \u201clanguage\u201d because \u201cquery language\u201d has a smell of various things that end with the letters \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cL\u201d.  But not passionate about that.\r\n*(Tim Bray)*\r\n\r\n> JSONPath: A query syntax for JSON.\r\n> Another wild-card idea: JSONPath: Query expressions for jSON\r\n*(Tim Bray)*\r\n\r\n> The beauty of this is that the plural form \u201cquery expressions\u201d implies a set of expressions, so it implies \u201clanguage\u201d.  It\u2019s indeed more than the grammar/syntax of those, so why not talk about the expressions as a whole.  This also makes it possible to just use \u201cfor JSON\u201d, without going into detail what these query expressions operate on.\r\n*(Carsten Bormann)*\r\n\r\nThere seems to be an agreement for \"*JSONPath: Query expressions for JSON*\". I like that also.\r\n\r\n## Terminology\r\n\r\n> My own view is that the terminology should stay consistent with RFC\r\n8259, and that the word \"object\" should not be used for items that are\r\nnot JSON objects in the sense of RFC 8259.\r\n*(Daniel P)*\r\n\r\n> To Carsten's point about what we call things, the number of distinguished\r\nterms per RFC8259 is pretty small: JSON text, value, object, array, number,\r\nstring.  Having spent quite a bit of time specifying JSON DSLs, I find that\r\nusing just those terms doesn't seem to get in the way or cause problems, so\r\nI'd argue that we should stick to them (and build up to higher-level\r\nconstructs as required for JSONPath).\r\n>\r\n> \u2026 oh, and I forgot the very useful \"member\".\r\n*(Tim Bray)*\r\n\r\n> \u2026 and \u201celement\u201d (the things in arrays). *(Carsten Bormann)*\r\n\r\n> The problem with JSON value is that it also can be quite confusing due to the usual use of that term.  Pointing to a tree and saying \u201cthe values inside that tree\u201d is not going to be felt as equivalent to \u201cthe set of all subtrees of that tree, including the tree itself\u201d.  But if JSON value is the only term we have, it has to be.  Hence my preference to talk about data items when I mean the items themselves and not their \u201cvalue\u201d.\r\n*(Carsten Bormann)*\r\n\r\n> I think the key difficulty is whether each (key, value) pair in an object is \"a thing\" that can be identified and manipulated and potentially returned. (If we're talking analogies, then it's analogous to an attribute node in the XDM model).\r\n*(Michael Kay)*\r\n\r\n> ECMA-404 uses \"name/value pair\", which is what I understand the term\r\n\"member\" to mean (Douglas Crockford uses \"member\").\r\n*(Daniel P)*\r\n\r\n> I think the term \u201cunion\u201d is poor. If we think of it as concatenation of results, then the result is as expected.\r\n*(Glyn Normington)*\r\n\r\nI understand, that within RFC8259 we have JSON values of different types. They are structured somehow, which is not so much of interest here.\r\n\r\nBut while querying that structure with JSONPath it is vitally important to identify that hierarchical structure as a tree. So in fact we build up a higher-level construct here. We also need to call \"the things\" in the tree somehow. I was able to identify\r\n\r\n* \"node\" or \"item\" of a tree\r\n* \"member\" of an object\r\n* \"name/value\" or \"key/value\" pair alias \"member\"\r\n* \"element\" of an array\r\n\r\nbut could not see an agreement here.\r\n\r\nI agree to Glyn calling the term \"union\" poor (s. below).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Differentiation from JSON Pointer (JSONPath draft charter)\r\n\r\n> I anticipate being asked \"Why is JSON Pointer not sufficient?\" Indeed its abstract says:\r\n>\r\n>   JSON Pointer defines a string syntax for identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document.\r\n>\r\n>... which sounds awfully similar.  If we could include a sentence about\r\nthat, or a link to an answer, that might be helpful.\r\n*(Murray S. Kucherawy)*\r\n\r\n> No - it's not similar in concept, they're separate things. If you really wanted to mention JSON Pointer, you could say something like \"Note that while JSON Pointer (RFC xxxx) is already standardised, it is designed to provide a reference to a single, specific part of a JSON document, whereas JSONPath provides the ability to query a document and potentially return multiple values.\"\r\n*(Mark Nottingham)*\r\n\r\n>The short answer is that JSON pointer is good if you already know the structure of the JSON data item you want to point into, and you want to point to exactly one position in there.  If you need to do something that is closer to a \u201csearch\u201d (which might also result in multiple positions), JSONPath gives you more rope.\r\n*(Carsten Bormann)*\r\n\r\n+1\r\n\r\n## References to XPath\r\n\r\n> I wonder if the analogies between XPath and JSONPath are going to be helpful, or whether they're actually dangerous by implying equivalences between constructs that are in fact somewhat different?\r\n*(Michael Kay)*\r\n\r\n> I tend to agree. Although JSONPath was inspired by XPath, I wouldn't\r\nwant to confuse the JSONPath spec by going into detailed comparisons at\r\nthe risk of contradicting the normative text.\r\n*(Glyn Normington)*\r\n\r\n> Someone on StackOverflow today asked a question about JSONPath; they called it (and tagged it) XPath, we really don't want that kind of confusion.\r\n>\r\n> In addition, the reference to the XPath specification in 6.2 is out of date, and the comparison with XPath in Table 2 is very approximate and the terminology inaccurate: for example there is a mention of \"node sets\", which exist in XPath 1.0 but not in XPath 2.0, yet the citation is to XPath 2.0. For someone who knows the semantics of XPath the comparison raises all sorts of questions about sorting of results into document order, elimination of duplicates etc, which are complications this spec can well do without. (Though some answers are needed, for example if ..store..price matches the same price in more than one way, do you get more than one result? And if not, what does \"the same price\" actually mean?)\r\n*(Michael Kay)*\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be important in 2007, while argumenting to have something like XPath for JSON. If nowadays the terminology used has changed significantly with XPath 2.0 and 3.0, we better leave that comparison table 2 out. I am quite passionless here.\r\n\r\n## Array Slice Operator\r\n\r\n> Thanks! The ABNF for an array slice in that reference\r\n> ```\r\n> integer = [%x2D] (%x30 / (%x31-39 *%x30-39))\r\n>\r\n> array-slice = [ integer ] ws %x3A ws [ integer ]\r\n>                     [ ws %x3A ws [ integer ] ]\r\n>                              ; start:end or start:end:step\r\n> ```\r\n> is consistent with JMESPath, Python, and my understanding of\r\nECMASCRIPT 4.\r\n> *(Daniel P)*\r\n\r\n> Did anyone else have an opinion on the behaviour of slices such as [::0]?\r\nThe current draft allows this and says it returns an empty array, but there\r\nis good reason to say it should error so that the slice operation is then\r\nconsistent with Python slicing. See below for more context.\r\n*(Glyn Normington)*\r\n\r\nIt's good having read this thread and thus understand the current draft much better. I like the decision to be consistent with Python and also getting an empty selection set with `step=0`.\r\n\r\nFYI: there is a recent proposal for adding slice notation syntax to JavaScript, currently at stage 1 of the TC39 process.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tc39/proposal-slice-notation\r\n\r\nInterestingly it won't have a step argument ...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tc39/proposal-slice-notation#why-doesnt-this-include-a-step-argument-like-python-does\r\n\r\n... because of syntax collision with the new `this-binding` syntax proposal `::`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tc39/proposal-bind-operator\r\n\r\nHowever, we should not let us influence by this.\r\n\r\n## Unions\r\n\r\n> I don't think any implementation would remove duplicates from a path\r\nsuch as `\"$.store.book\"`. I believe this is only somewhat controversial\r\nin the context of unions [,]. The name \"union\" suggests that distinct\r\nvalues be returned, compare with SQL unions. But Stefan Goessner's\r\nimplementation doesn't do that, it concatenates all results that meet\r\neach criteria. There are a few JSONPath implementations that produce\r\nreal unions with no duplicates instead of concatenated results, but I\r\ndon't think that's the consensus.\r\n*(Daniel P)*\r\n\r\n> I think the term \u201cunion\u201d is poor. If we think of it as concatenation of results, then the result is as expected.\r\n*(Glyn Normington)*\r\n\r\n> I agree with that comment, but it's partly because I'm used to SQL UNION,\r\nwhich is different. I prefer the JMESPath term for an analogous construct,\r\nMultiSelect List, https://jmespath.org/specification.html#multiselect-list.\r\n*(Daniel P)*\r\n\r\nIntroducing the union operator `[,]` simply was meant an analogon to XPath's operator `'|'`. I cannot tell, if it was a simple combination of node sets in Xpath 1.0 or a true union without duplicates. I obviously was not aware of that subtle (essential ?) union characteristic.\r\n\r\nSo I fully agree to Glyn Normington's '... the term \u201cunion\u201d is poor' statement. Are there some better alternative terms, perhaps 'multi-index operator', 'index list', 'subscript list', etc.?\r\n\r\n## Duplicates and Ordering\r\n\r\n> It was my impression that we were talking about duplicated nodes not\r\nduplicated values:\r\n>\r\n> Given th array [10,20,30]\r\n>\r\n> $..[0,1,0]\r\n>\r\n> Would yield only two results [10, 20]\r\n>\r\n> (Not that I'm advocating for removing duplicates, personally I think we\r\nshouldn't)\r\n*(Marko Mikulicic)*\r\n\r\n> You\u2019re framing this as \u201cremoving duplicates\u201d.\r\nAnother view is that [10, 20, 10] would be \u201cadding duplicates\u201d (copies of the same node). Related are ordering issues:\r\n>\r\n> `$..[1,0] \u2794 [20, 10] Or [10, 20]`\r\n>\r\n> I would expect the spec will leaves implementations some leeway here, but that should be based on an examination of existing implementations.\r\n*(Carsten Bormann)*\r\n\r\n> The mental model that leads to omitting duplicate nodes in the output is\r\n\"selection\": if you take an input array and select nodes with index 0,1 or\r\n0, you get only 2 results (since selecting an index twice has no effect).\r\n>\r\n>OTOH, if you opt for a \"collect\" model, whenever you encounter a node that\r\nmatches that query you add it to the result stream, thus the same nodes can\r\nbe present multiple times in the result.\r\n>\r\n>I have a slight preference for the \"collect\" model, because the general\r\ncase in jsonpath is to collect things that appear at various points in the\r\njson tree. For example:\r\n>\r\n>`{\"a\": {\"b\": 1, \"c\": 2}, \"d\": 3},  $.a.b yields [1] and not {\"a\":{\"b\":1}}`\r\n>\r\n>(i.e. jsonpath is not a filter and view operation but a pick and gather\r\noperation)\r\n*(Marko Mikulicic)*\r\n\r\n> In implementations that support paths (the majority don't), the query\r\nfunction takes a parameter that indicates values or paths. In both\r\ncases the query returns a JSON array of JSON values, in the latter\r\ncase, a JSON array of normalized paths.\r\n*(Daniel P)*\r\n\r\nI must confess to never having thought about duplicates, let alone wanting to eliminate them. So I do like Marko's comparison of 'selection-model' vs. 'collection-model' a lot. I would opt for the latter. In this sense the result of a 'JSONPath query expression' should be termed a 'collection'.\r\n\r\nRegarding ordering I see something like a 'natural ordering', according to which\r\n\r\n`$..[0,1] \u2794 [10, 20]`\r\n`$..[1,0] \u2794 [20, 10]`\r\n\r\nwould result with the example above.\r\n\r\nI do understand the use cases for reordering, duplicates removal, filtering, etc.. But this can always be seen as a postprocessing step on the resulting collection by handing it over to accompanying tools (think of pipe operator).\r\n\r\nOf course this cannot work on the result collection of values alone (s. duplicate nodes vs. duplicate values above), it rather requires a collection of (normalized) pathes. In this sense, I like this view:\r\n\r\n> In my opinion the right balance between powerfulness and enabling\r\nsimple implementations has been so far one of the key factors that\r\nmade JSONPath popular over other alternatives, even if it lacks\r\nsupport for aggregation functions.\r\n*(Davide Bettio)*\r\n\r\n## Filter Expressions\r\n\r\n> Related to that, it would be helpful to determine if JSONPath filters\r\napply to both JSON objects and arrays, or only to JSON arrays.\r\n*(Daniel P)*\r\n\r\n> I would support restricting filters to arrays, if others agree.\r\n*(Glyn Normington)*\r\n\r\nI tend to let implementations and their \"normative force of the factual\" decide here or in doubt agree to Glyn's restriction to arrays.\r\n\r\nI am very unhappy with confusing `$..book[(@.length-1)]`, where `'@'` addresses the array itself and implies that array has a `length` property. In filter expression examples `'@'` more consistently addresses the current array element.\r\n\r\nThe invocation of 'the underlying scripting engine' wasn't meant a serious normative aspect, but rather a quick and dirty solution for JavaScript and PHP implementations at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Corner Case\r\n\r\n> Consider this perfectly legal JSON object\r\n>\r\n> ```{ \"ab\": 0,  \"'a.b\": 1,  \"a-b\": 2, \"a\": { \"b\": 3 } }```\r\n>\r\n>So `$.ab` is 0, `$.a.b` is 3, `$['a.b']` is 1, `$['a-b']` is 2. You'd like to say `$.a-b` but lots of libraries will refuse it because `\"a-b\"` is not a legal JavaScript \"name\" construct, that's why you have to say `$['a-b']`.\r\n>\r\n> But suppose your library would accept `$.a-b`.  Then `$.a-b` and `$['a-b']` would be synonyms, but `$.a.b` and `$['a.b']` wouldn't.\r\n*(Tim Bray)*\r\n\r\nHmm ... this seems to be a hint to better exclude `'-'` from dot-child-selector syntax. I think I have read more discussion about that, currently don't know where.\r\n\r\n## Respect Implementations\r\n\r\n> As I mentioned in the session, I think there's a non-trivial amount of risk here that some implementations won't be willing or able to move away from their current behaviours, even if interoperability would improve if they did so. However, there are ways to mitigate that (e.g., a separate 'rfcxxxx compliant' mode). Even so, it will be important to get good participation from as many current implementers as possible.\r\n*(Mark Nottingham)*\r\n\r\n> The WG will develop a standards-track JSONPath specification that\r\nis technically sound and complete, based on the common semantics\r\nand other aspects of existing implementations.  Where there are\r\ndifferences, the working group will analyze those differences and\r\nmake choices that rough consensus considers technically best, with\r\nan aim toward minimizing disruption among the different JSONPath\r\nimplementations.\r\n*(Barry Leiba)*\r\n\r\n> I'm OK with this, but for context: I've been a pretty intense JSONPath user\r\nin recent years, and AFAIK the spec, and the implementations, are mostly\r\nOK, so the choice between \"make JSONPath good\" and \"don't invalidate\r\nimplementations\" is unlikely to come up. If it did, my predisposition would\r\nbe to err on the side of not breaking implementations, but I don't think\r\nthat's inconsistent with Barry's text.\r\n*(Tim Bray)*\r\n\r\n+1 to all.\r\n\r\n## Error Handling\r\n\r\n> My mental model at the moment is that a JSONPath expression can be valid or erroneous; application of a valid expression yields a result (which may be empty), but does not raise errors.  That may not be the right model for all applications.\r\n*(Carsten Bormann)*\r\n\r\n> The  general approach that I've seen several times (including my\r\nElixir implementation) is that an error is raised when there is a\r\nsyntax error, therefore an invalid expression (e.g. $.foo[[5]) raises\r\nan error. Conversely a valid expression applied to a bogus input never\r\nraises an error (e.g. `$.foo.bar on \"test\" evals as []`).\r\n*(Davide Bettio)*\r\n\r\n> On the whole I think JSONPath is designed to be \"forgiving\", i.e. such things aren't errors, e.g. I think I read in the spec that filtering a non-array isn't an error, it's some kind of no-op. That approach isn't always best for everyone, but it's important to be consistent.\r\n*(Michael Kay)*\r\n\r\n> I would expect one component of this policy to be:\r\n>\r\n> Whether a JSONPath query is valid or not does not depend on the arguments it is applied to.\r\n>\r\n> I.e., you can look at the query and find out independently, without knowing any data, whether it is valid or not.\r\n*(Carsten Bormann)*\r\n\r\nI like and totally agree with the *forgiving mental model*, so having  only syntax errors, which do not dependent on data.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n-- \r\nsg ",

      "body": "In the [W3C Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/), we have been working on a new standard for Discovery (which looks up metadata about IoT devices encoded in JSON-LD files) that includes JSON Path as one query mechanism.  We are therefore very happy to see this effort to standardize JSON Path, as it will make it much much easier to reference (and keep consistent) in a W3C Recommendation (our alternative would be to make up our own JSON Path spec, which we obviously want to avoid at all costs).   For general information on WoT Discovery, please see the [w3c/wot-discovery repo](https://github.com/w3c/wot-discovery) and in particular the [Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/wot-discovery) of our spec.  I should mention we also plan to support XPath and SPARQL as optional alternative query languages but would like to make JSON Path the basic requirement for all implementations.\r\n\r\nWe will likely follow up with other issues later related to the use of JSON Path WoT Discovery more generally later; however lately we have also been discussing geolocation and the use of JSON Pointers to define the location of this information in order to deal with various use cases like devices installed in a static location, devices using other devices for their location, devices with dynamic updates of location (vehicles, etc).  Ultimately we would like to have a set of \"geolocation filters\" in WoT Discovery that lets us filter query results by location.  These can be independent of JSON Path; however, we first have to collect the geolocation information together with a JSON Path query, and that (at least) requires the following:\r\n\r\n* The ability to follow \"relative\" JSON pointers (i.e. URLS with just the fragment part) within a document and collect the information.\r\n\r\nSee my [geolocation proposal](https://github.com/mmccool/wot-discovery/blob/geolocation-proposal/proposals/geolocation.md) for a writeup and some examples.   Note there are ALSO examples of JSON pointers referring to data schemas and to external files in that proposal, both of which would require an additional dereferencing step, and it would be OK to NOT support these in JSON Path (or rather, leave it up to the consumer to follow these external references themselves, so unresolved JSON Pointers could be included in the result in these cases).\r\n\r\nIf the above is confusing, I apologize, but let's discuss and hopefully I can clarify.",

Particularly as section 3.6.2.3 begins with \"A child is a quoted string.\" If it's a quoted string, why not call it a \"quoted-string\"? Generally I find that in other grammars, authors take care to use token names that are intuitive, and natural to use in the body of the text. I'd like to see that more in the JSONPath specification as well.\r\n\r\nOn a related point, the grammar _defines_ a \"dot-child-name\" as an unquoted string. However, thanks to Burgmer's excellent comparisons, we know that a majority of implementations support [dot notation with single quotes](https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/results/dot_notation_with_single_quotes.html), and a significant minority also support [dot notation with double quotes](https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/results/dot_notation_with_double_quotes.html). It seems to me that it would therefore be natural to define\r\n```\r\nidentifier = unquoted-string / quoted-string \r\n\r\nquoted-string = single-quoted-string / double-quoted-string\r\n\r\nunion-element = quoted-string\r\n\r\nselector = dot-child      \r\n    \r\ndot-child = \".\" identifier\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn section 3.6.1, when discussing the dot notation, the term \"Union Child\" is used, referring to section 3.6.2.3, but this section does not define \"Union Child\", it defines \"child\". In my opinion, terms used in the body of the text should always be consistent with the tokens in the grammar, including with respect to case.\r\n\r\n### Normalized path expressions\r\n\r\nThe draft states, in section 1.3,\r\n\r\n\"Where a JSONPath processor uses JSONPath expressions as output paths, these will always be converted to normalized JSONPath expressions which employ the more general bracket-notation. [2] Bracket notation is more general than dot notation and can serve as a canonical form when a JSONPath processor uses JSONPath expressions as output paths.\"\r\n\r\n### Remarks:\r\n\r\n- Is the notation \"[2]\" intended to be a reference? If so, to what does it refer? \r\n- This paragraph uses the term \"normalized JSONPath expressions\", and is the only place in the draft where this exact expression occurs. \"Normalized Path Expression\" is used in Section 1.1.\r\n- The draft refers to this section in Section 1.1 when introducing the term \"Normalized Path Expression\", but the above text cannot be considered a definition. Intuitively what is required is a path in the bracket notation with only non-negative indices and single quoted names allowed, both those restrictions are required for canonical form.\r\n\r\n### Wildcard with bracket notation\r\n\r\nThe draft gives examples of using a wildcard with the bracket notation, e.g. `$.store.book[*].author`, but it's not covered in the grammar.\r\n\r\nOne approach would be to treat it symmetrically as a union element, i.e.\r\n\r\n    union-element =/ \"[\" \"*\" \"]\"\r\n\r\nNote that a query like\r\n\r\n    $.store.book[*,*]\r\n\r\ndoesn't make much sense, but it does no harm, and some implementations support that, e.g. Goessner. \r\n\r\n### Filters\r\n\r\nFilters are largely unmentioned in the current draft, apart from examples. \r\n\r\nIs it intended to also support filters and expressions as \"union elements\"?\r\n\r\nReferring to https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/results/union_with_filter.html,\r\nsix out of 41 implementations support union with filter elements. \r\n\r\n### node\r\n\r\nIt's unclear what the draft means by \"node\", which occurs 60 times in the text. In section 3.2, it says \"Each node holds a JSON value\", but it doesn't say what else the node holds (a position or path to that point?) And then we have \"root node which is the input document\", which suggests the root node is a value. My own understanding of a node is a path/value pair, and I think the draft needs to be more clear about this term, and to distinguish between root and current nodes, and the corresponding root and current values.\r\n\r\n### Data Item\r\n\r\nSection 1.1 defines the term \"Data Item\" as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A structure complying to the generic data model of JSON, i.e., composed of containers, namely JSON objects and arrays, and of atomic data, namely null, true, false, numbers, and text strings. Also called a JSON value.\"\r\n\r\nBut if \"Data Item\" means the same as \"JSON value\", why introduce it at all? I note that the term \"JSON value\" occurs 13 times in the draft; \"Data Item\" occurs 15 times. I think there is some risk, in a document with multiple authors and multiple critics, that people have different preferred terms, and that as a compromise, all terms get used. But this is not helpful to implementers, for implementers, one term is best. \r\n\r\n### Position\r\n\r\nIn section 1.1, which introduces terminology, the draft defines Position as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A JSON data item identical to or nested within the JSON data item to which the query is applied to, expressed either by the value of that data item or by providing a Normalized Path Expression as a JSONPath Output Path.\"\r\n\r\n#### Remarks\r\n\r\n- The expression \"the JSON data item to which the query is applied to\" is awkward, and could be substituted with \"root\", which is a term used 11 times in the draft from Section 1.3 on. I would suggest introducing \"root\" in the terminology section, and using it.\r\n- I don't understand what this sentence means. What does it mean to say that \"Position\" _is_ the root or a nested data item and _can_ be expressed by the value of that data item (as well as by a Normalized Path Expression)? Intuitively, my understanding of \"Position\" is that it is the location of an item within the root, and can be represented by a Normalized Path Expression.\r\n\r\n### General observation\r\n\r\nIf I compare the draft to the [JMESPath specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html), one thing that stands out is that in the JMESPath specification, every definition is expressed in terms of tokens that are defined in the grammar, and the names in the grammar correspond to intuition. This makes the JMESPath specification very clear. But that's not always the case in the draft. For example, the text about Normalized Path Expression uses terms such as \"bracket notation\" that are not found in the grammar, and the grammar uses names like \"child\" that cannot be easily understood if used bare without more context.\r\n\r\nI think it would be helpful if the draft consistently described things in terms of tokens that are defined in the grammar, and that the names in the grammar are natural ones to use in the text. On that note, I would suggest that \"child\" is not a natural way to refer to a quoted string in brackets.\r\n\r\nMy own view is that describing Normalized Path Expression in terms of \"union\", \"union element\" and \"child\" would be awkward, which suggests to me that additional tokens might be introduced into the grammar to represent bracketed expressions with a single item.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "I was thinking a while about `[(...)]` expressions (we may need another term here: 'evaluatable' or something) and filter expressions `[?(...)]` (or simply 'filters'?).\r\n\r\nIn order to discuss bracket-notation inside of JSONPath expressions &ndash; leaving out unions for now, we can address implicitly either JSON objects by using a string indicating a member name ...\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$..['name']  // (1) ... array elements can't be selected this way ...\r\n             //     Prefer using single quotes, so allow JSONPath \r\n             //     expressions being JSON text strings, defined \r\n             //     in [RFC8259]. \r\n```\r\nor JSON arrays by using an integer as array index.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$..[42]  // (2) ... object members can't be selected this way ...\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure, how strict or forgiving implementations handle `$..['42']` here ... I assume the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### `$..[(#)]`\r\n\r\nNow, when applying `$..[(#)]`, then abstract `'#'` should evaluate to a string in case of (1) and to an integer in case of (2), if it wants to have a chance to select anything.\r\n\r\nNow consider the root selector `'$'` being part of the evaluatable in question ...\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{ \"key\":\"name\", \"o\": {\"name\":\"x\"} }\r\n\r\n$..[($.key)]  // ... \"x\"\r\n```\r\nand ...\r\n```js\r\n{ \"idx\": 2, \"a\": [\"v\",\"w\",\"x\"] }\r\n\r\n$..[($.idx)]  // ... \"x\"\r\n```\r\nJSON documents containing such a level of indirection may be treated well by JSONPath this way. It's hard for me to imagine other use cases, since both expression must resolve to string and integer, in order to make sense.\r\n\r\nThis time consider the current element/node indicator `'@'` being used ...\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{ \"o\": {\"key\":\"name\", \"name\":\"x\"} }\r\n\r\n$..[(@.key)]  // ... \"x\"\r\n```\r\nand ...\r\n```js\r\n{ \"a\": [2,\"v\",\"w\",\"x\"] }\r\n\r\n$..[(@[0])]  // ... \"x\"\r\n```\r\nAgain both expression must resolve to string and integer respectively. So current item `'@'` needs to reference its container, i.e. object `'o'` and array `'a'` in the examples above. The benefit is significantly less here in contrast to the use of the root selector `'$'`. Again we can perform some kind of 'pointing' from one location to another in a single JSON document. But this time an object member is addressed more restrictively from its direct descendant or from its sibling or thats descendant. \r\n\r\nMy former example `$..book[(@.length-1)]` addresses via `'@'` the array `book`\r\nand implies that it has a member with name `length`. This is true for JavaScript, but does not apply generally and thus makes it a bad example.\r\n\r\nDaniel largely agrees with the uselessness of this case in his post \"@ and the current element\" on the list https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/jsonpath/, but he and others may have some other practical uses in mind ... ?\r\n\r\n### `$..[#]`\r\n\r\nDaniel is pointing to another variant of expression evaluating `$..[@.address.city]` on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55497833/jsonpath-union-of-multiple-different-paths/55505099#55505099). Basically\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{ \"a\":{\"b\":{\"c\":\"x\"} } }\r\n\r\n$..[@.b.c]  // ... \"x\", which yields identical results to\r\n$..b.c \r\n```\r\nthat use is questionable, as there exists another more intuitive JSONPath query delivering the same result, as shown in the example. Interesting is the idea, that the expression inside the brackets is evaluated, as if it were outside. Current item `'@'` here references its container as in `$..[(#)]` expressions above. A benefit (?) of that might come in combination with unions, which we won't discuss here (but possibly in another later issue).\r\n\r\n### `$..[?(#)]`\r\n\r\nJSONPath filters seem to be of most practical use. It allows to perform tests while iterating over a JSON container (object or array). If the boolean test results in `true`, the object member or array element is selected, thus filtering data items out. In tests the symbols `'$'` and `'@'` may be used, meaning the *root node* and *current node* (is *node* a valid term in the draft?), as in ...\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{ \"find\":\"red\",\r\n   \"a\": [\"yellow\",\"green\",\"red\"],\r\n   \"o\": { \"size\":12, \"color\":\"red\"}\r\n}\r\n\r\n$.a[?(@ == $.find)]      // ... \"red\"\r\n$.o[?(@ == 'red')]       // ... no match, '@' holds a 'name/value' pair.\r\n$.o[?(@.color == 'red')] // ... member \"color\":\"red\".\r\n```\r\nIt's important to note, that symbol `'@'` herein does not reference the JSON container as before with `[(...)]` expressions, but the members or elements contained, while iterating.\r\n\r\nInterestingly there is good agreement with arrays, but obviously confusion regarding objects among the implementations. See enlightening issue [#47](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-jsonpath/issues/47) for discussion.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nWorkgroup members seem to be very reluctant regarding those evaluatable expressions (see [Glyn's comment](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-jsonpath/issues/47#issuecomment-746125759)). One reason might be security considerations [#25](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-jsonpath/issues/25). I find [Greg's comment](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-jsonpath/issues/47#issuecomment-747165396) remarkable, where he proposes two of the following options:\r\n\r\n1. not supporting evaluatable expressions at all.\r\n2. only support filters (for now?).\r\n3. only support filters on arrays (for now?).\r\n4. ... \"SHOULD NOT evaluate objects\" and leave it to implementations.\r\n5. ... \"MUST be behind an option that defaults to 'not supported.'\"\r\n\r\nI think, whatever option we will choose &ndash; my favorite would be 2. possibly combined with 4. and/or 5. &ndash; there should be a clear definition, how `'@'` symbol is to be interpreted, when used by implementations. I'm not sure, if this requires an explicit grammar and if so, how detailed it has to be then.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure, if it's possible, to announce addition of those stuff to later versions of the draft (like [TC39](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) handles proposals).\r\n",

      "body": "[JSON Schema 2020-12, Section 6](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html#rfc.section.6), specifies a set of general considerations that I think we can \"borrow\" from.  I'll copy it here for reference and add comments.\r\n\r\n> ### 6. General Considerations\r\n> #### 6.1. Range of JSON Values\r\n> An instance may be any valid JSON value as defined by JSON. JSON Schema imposes no restrictions on type: JSON Schema can describe any JSON value, including, for example, null.\r\n\r\nJSON Schema uses the word \"instance\" to describe the JSON data that's being validated.  We seem to have landed on the word \"data.\"  Regardless, I think the gist of this also holds true for JSON Path: input values can be of any JSON type (although only certain types may return results depending on the Path).\r\n\r\n> #### 6.2. Programming Language Independence\r\n> JSON Schema is programming language agnostic, and supports the full range of values described in the data model. Be aware, however, that some languages and JSON parsers may not be able to represent in memory the full range of values describable by JSON.\r\n\r\nThis, I think, is of utmost importance.  We definitely **should not** favor a specific language.  Doing so would inhibit inclusivity and shun people who work in incompatible frameworks.\r\n\r\nThis statement also makes it clear that it's understood that some frameworks inherently have limitations that may prevent them from being able to implement the full expression of JSON Schema.  Declaring this outright allows such frameworks to have partial \"best effort\" implementations and still be compliant with the specification.\r\n\r\n> #### 6.3. Mathematical Integers\r\n> Some programming languages and parsers use different internal representations for floating point numbers than they do for integers.\r\n> \r\n> For consistency, integer JSON numbers SHOULD NOT be encoded with a fractional part.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this would apply for us, except maybe for array indices.\r\n\r\n> #### 6.4. Regular Expressions\r\n> Keywords MAY use regular expressions to express constraints, or constrain the instance value to be a regular expression. These regular expressions SHOULD be valid according to the regular expression dialect described in ECMA-262, section 21.2.1.\r\n> \r\n> Regular expressions SHOULD be built with the \"u\" flag (or equivalent) to provide Unicode support, or processed in such a way which provides Unicode support as defined by ECMA-262.\r\n> \r\n> Furthermore, given the high disparity in regular expression constructs support, schema authors SHOULD limit themselves to the following regular expression tokens:\r\n> \r\n> - individual Unicode characters, as defined by the JSON specification;\r\n> - simple character classes ([abc]), range character classes ([a-z]);\r\n> - complemented character classes ([^abc], [^a-z]);\r\n> - simple quantifiers: \"+\" (one or more), \"*\" (zero or more), \"?\" (zero or one), and their lazy versions (\"+?\", \"*?\", \"??\");\r\n> - range quantifiers: \"{x}\" (exactly x occurrences), \"{x,y}\" (at least x, at most y, occurrences), {x,} (x occurrences or more), and their lazy versions;\r\n> - the beginning-of-input (\"^\") and end-of-input (\"$\") anchors;\r\n> - simple grouping (\"(...)\") and alternation (\"|\").\r\n> - Finally, implementations MUST NOT take regular expressions to be anchored, neither at the beginning nor at the end. This means, for instance, the pattern \"es\" matches \"expression\".\r\n\r\nNot sure if we're planning on supporting regular expressions.  It appears that some implementations do have some support, but it's all extension on the original syntax at this point.  Still, this is a good declaration of support.\r\n\r\nIt also ties in closely to section 6.2 regarding framework limitations as not all frameworks support the same flavor of regular expression syntax.\r\n\r\n> #### 6.5. Extending JSON Schema\r\n> Additional schema keywords and schema vocabularies MAY be defined by any entity. Save for explicit agreement, schema authors SHALL NOT expect these additional keywords and vocabularies to be supported by implementations that do not explicitly document such support. Implementations SHOULD treat keywords they do not support as annotations, where the value of the keyword is the value of the annotation.\r\n> \r\n> Implementations MAY provide the ability to register or load handlers for vocabularies that they do not support directly. The exact mechanism for registering and implementing such handlers is implementation-dependent.\r\n\r\nThis is good to have because invariably, implementations will want to extend functionality beyond what's in the spec.  It basically covers other implementations from also having to provide the same extensions, requiring only what is stated in the spec.\r\n\r\nIt also mentions \"vocabularies,\" which are a spec-defined mechanism by which implementation _can_ extend functionality via new keywords in such a way that they can optionally be supported in other implementations.  Furthermore, this mechanism allows the other implementations to refuse to process a schema that _requires_ a given vocabulary if the implementation doesn't understand it.  This bit I think is good for later when we eventually get to spec-defined extension mechanisms, but I don't expect that'll be in the first draft.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThat's it.  Just some declarations that I think would be good to have.  This is neither an exclusive nor \"all or nothing\" list.  I think we should pick and choose as we see fit.  If you think of something that's not in this list, let us know.\r\n\r\n",

The \"outer context\" is the root value at which JSONPath evaluation starts. Relative paths only have meaning inside the context of JSONPath evaluation. Within a filter expression, the current node changes as evaluation iterates over its parent. Relative paths starting with \"@\" can be evaluated against the current node.\r\n\r\nIn your original example, it seemed to me that you had a JSONPath expression, and in one case, you wanted to evaluate it against one value, and in another case, you wanted to evaluate it against another. In both cases you're going to evaluate a JSONPath expression against a value that you provide. \r\n\r\n",

The \"outer context\" is the root value at which JSONPath evaluation starts. \r\n\r\nJSONPath at the moment doesn't provide a mechanism for allowing users to choose whether their expression is relative to the JSON document root (absolute path) or to a any node inside that document.\r\n\r\nThis feature is crucial when JSONPath will be used inside of other software solutions / future specifications.\r\n\r\nLet's think about how XPath is used inside of XSLT again:\r\n```xml\r\n<xsl:for-each select=\"root/a/b/c\">\r\n  <item>\r\n    <y><xsl:value-of select=\"d\"/></y>\r\n    <z><xsl:value-of select=\"/root/e\"/></z>\r\n  </item>\r\n</xsl:for-each>\r\n```\r\n`xsl:for-each` iterates over a collection of `c` tags, at each iteration the XPath current context is set to the `xsl:for-each` current item, however the document root is still accessible by using `/` prefix.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<z><xsl:value-of select=\"/root/e\"/></z>\r\n<y><xsl:value-of select=\"d\"/></y>\r\n```\r\nhere `/root/e` is always the same element because the `/` prefix tells the XPath evaluator that the path is relative to the document root, on the other hand the path `d` has no `/` prefix, therefore it is relative to the current context which is changed by the XSTL engine at each `xsl:for-each` iteration.\r\n\r\nJSONPath right now doesn't allow this kind of flexibility using JSONPath language constructs (but it is required to workaround this limitation and it feels quite unnatural), I would expect absolute and relative paths concepts to be part of the specification, in a similar way to XPath.\r\n\r\n> this is an advanced usage\r\n\r\nI don't agree here, when using XPath it is really a basic feature.\r\n\r\nQuoting [XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/#location-paths) doc:\r\n> There are two kinds of location path: relative location paths and absolute location paths.\r\n>\r\n> A relative location path consists of a sequence of one or more location steps separated by /. The steps in a relative location path are composed together from left to right. Each step in turn selects a set of nodes relative to a context node. An initial sequence of steps is composed together with a following step as follows. The initial sequence of steps selects a set of nodes relative to a context node. Each node in that set is used as a context node for the following step. The sets of nodes identified by that step are unioned together. The set of nodes identified by the composition of the steps is this union. For example, child::div/child::para selects the para element children of the div element children of the context node, or, in other words, the para element grandchildren that have div parents.\r\n>\r\n> An absolute location path consists of / optionally followed by a relative location path. A / by itself selects the root node of the document containing the context node. If it is followed by a relative location path, then the location path selects the set of nodes that would be selected by the relative location path relative to the root node of the document containing the context node.that would be selected by the relative location path relative to the root node of the document containing the context node.\r\n\r\nConcerning my opinion I think that it would be a quite annoying limitation not having support for relative paths. I'm ok about postponing discussion on implementation details (such as which syntax would be better) to a future discussion, but I think that discussing at least if we want this feature or not is quite important.\r\n\r\nSo honestly I would expect reaching a consensus about whether we want somehow add this kind of feature to the spec, or leave it completely out as soon as possible.",

But please know that I'm coming at this with no knowledge on XPath except what you've described, so please bear with me.\n\nBased on your example, XPath appears to be hierarchical in its declaration.  Each level declares its own set of selectors. Because of this, yes, it's important that XPath support relative (acts on the currently-processed location) and absolute (acts on the root of the initial data argument) selection patterns.\n\nJSON Path distinguishes between these using the `@` (current location) and `$` (root) operators.\n\nIt also appears that it's building a new XML object in the form in line with the structure of the XPath query.

It is only intended for finding data, not constructing new values from that data.

It is only intended for finding data, not constructing new values from that data.\r\n\r\nBasically I'm not asking/meaning this.\r\n\r\nMy point is about enabling users writing both paths relative to a context (which is defined outside JSONPath) and absolute paths (which refer to the document root by using $).\r\n\r\nAt the moment I'm not strongly opinionated about how we are going to do this, but let's suppose just for a moment we are going enabling it by using `@'.\r\n\r\nTherefore given:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"d\": \"bar\",\r\n  \"e\": \"foo\",\r\n  \"arr\": [{\"d\": 1, \"e\": \"test1\"}, {\"d\": 2, \"e\": \"test2\"}, {\"d\": 2, \"e\": \"test2\"}]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we choose `$.arr[0]` as context (which is `{\"d\": 1, \"e\": \"test1\"}`) I would expect following JSONPaths evaluating to:\r\n\r\n* `$.e` -> `[\"foo\"]`\r\n* `$.arr[0].e` -> `[\"test1\"]`\r\n* `@.e` -> `[\"test1\"]`\r\n* `$.d` -> `\"bar\"`\r\n* `@.d` -> `[1]`\r\n\r\nRemark: I don't care if we are going to use `@` or `\u20ac` for this purpose, I just care about allowing writing two different kind of paths (as XPaths does) that allow writing expressions equivalent to the ones I wrote before.",

          "body": "Thank you for the detailed summary and explanation.\n\nLooking at your example of what you expect to happen at the end of your comment, this is precisely what the current syntax does _within the context of evaluation_.\n\nHowever, `@` is not valid at the beginning of a standalone path.  It seems this is what you're asking for.\n\n_As an aside, I think there's a further deviation between [proper JSON](https://www.json.org/) ([spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159)) and XML in that JSON doesn't have the idea of a top-level document.  Because of this, tooling can just pass whatever current JSON value it has to a proper path evaluator to get the required output.  This is the current state of things, which is what we're actively trying to define at this time._\n\nHowever, I can see the benefit of allowing a path to start with `@` to indicate to such tooling which JSON value.  I believe some implementations support this as well (to be verified).  Basically your XML example from earlier in a hypothetical JSONT could be\n\n```\n\u200b{\n  \"for-each\u200b\": {\n   \u00a0\u200b\"select\": \"\u200b$.a.b.c\u200b\"\u200b,\n    \"item\u200b\": {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"y\u200b\": \"@.\u200bd\u200b\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"z\u200b\": \"$.e\u200b\"\u200b\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe difference between `@.d` and `$.e` becomes immediately apparent and is more of a cue to the JSONT implementation (which knows the difference between the JSON value it was given and the current JSON value) than the JSON Path evaluator.\n\nBut this only works if the JSON Path evaluator allows starting a path with `@`.  So that's your proposal.\n\n---\n\nProposal: allow paths to start with `@`.  It operates no differently than `$`, but can serve as an important indicator to tooling and other systems that consume JSON Path.\n\nMoreover, I believe it would help define such paths when defined within filter expressions.

Taken literally, it would make problematic some of what's in the draft, such as requiring that slices can appear as elements in union expressions, see [Union with slice and number](https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/results/union_with_slice_and_number.html), less than half of implementations (17 out of 41) support that, in particular, the important Jayway implementation doesn't have that, so a vast part of the JSONPath ecosystem doesn't have that.\r\n\r\nRealistically, legacy implementations are unlikely to introduce breaking changes regardless of what's in the draft. For example, the legacy Java ecosystem is not going to change the meaning of a filter applied to a JSON object, even though it's an outlier. But generalizations of the notation, such as allowing a path to begin with `@`, or allowing slices to appear as union elements, are not breaking changes. It is conceivable, although far from a certainty, that a legacy implementation could adopt some of these. But it's the new implementations, or existing ones with a comparatively small userbase, that we can expect to follow the specification. Perhaps in ten years we might find widespread adherence to the specification.  In any case, I trust nobody believes that it is possible to have an _interoperable_ specification that does not fail to comply with some feature of _every_ existing JSONPath implementation. It's apparent already in the few lines of grammar in the draft, it will become even more apparent when the WG tackles filter predicates.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

How many implementations allow a \"current value\" to be passed in rather than merely supporting \"leading @\"?\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, I think we all clarified now, in other discussions, that this is not an issue and it is 100% compatible with our charter.\r\n\r\nBy the way [ExJSONPath](https://github.com/ispirata/exjsonpath/) implements it ;) I also did a quick check (only) on [Jayway Java](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) and it has the following function:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic EvaluationContext evaluate(Object document, Object rootDocument, Configuration configuration, boolean forUpdate)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever I'm not a Java developer so I'm not sure how this is exposed through the API.\r\n\r\nHonestly I don't plan to check all ther other implementations, since it is not required/useful for our discussion (again it is not a WG charter requirement and also it is a time consuming activity).\r\n\r\n@glyn:\r\n> This would increase the surface area of the spec (i.e. allowing a \"current value\" to be passed in)\r\n\r\nIt is completely optional, implementations will not be required to follow this part of the spec and they can stick to the document root as default initial current value.\r\nThe surface increase is merely telling implementers that current item can be (if they want / if they need it) set to a descendant node as initial node (instead of the root node).\r\nI also think that defining an API is out-of-scope, but mentioning that a different (than the document root) initial current item can be chosen is fine.  \r\n\r\n@glyn:\r\n> without a compelling use case.\r\n\r\nI got following feedbacks:\r\n\r\n@gregsdennis\r\n> However, I can see the benefit of allowing a path to start with @ to indicate to such tooling which JSON value. I believe some implementations support this as well (to be verified).\r\n\r\n@gregsdennis:\r\n> It's opening a door for others, that's all.\r\n\r\n@danielaparker:\r\n> Okay, I agree with that, so we may now be up to a minority of two :-)\r\n\r\n@goessner:\r\n> I think, the json_path_eval(root, root.foo, \"@.bar\") example makes the usefulness of relative pathes for tools cristal clear.\r\n\r\nIt looks to me that there is some agreement about its usefulness.\r\n\r\n@glyn:\r\n> In other words, this feels like a solution looking for a problem. ;-)\r\n\r\n@gregsdennis made [an example](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/59#issuecomment-797212814) (similar to my usecase) that vastly benefit from a similar feature.\r\n\r\nAlso again this is about \"opening a door\" we don't need to know all the possibilities in advance.\r\n\r\nAs a \"philosophical\" point of view I also believe that the relative path concept is a widely known concept tight to the path concept. Nearly every time some kind of path is defined, a relative path concept is defined as a consequence as well.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, this feature has a XPath 1.0 counterpart so we are not introducing a new feature out of the blue, and we already know that it is a widely used feature in XPath.\r\n\r\n> Also, I think arguments about simplifying the grammar of filters are moot until we have such a grammar.\r\n\r\nWe already know that it will (I know it because I had the same kind of issue when I was working to my implementation), `json-path` rule with my changes can be used as-is for a (likely) filter grammar definition, since it provides a uniform definition for both `@.foo` and `$.bar` cases, which doesn't require additional filter specific path definitions.",

See [Support for path axis navigation](https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/issues/88) for discussion pertaining to this query, and why the implementations give different results for values.

Following some discussion [elsewhere](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-jsonpath/issues/74#issuecomment-799717411) about expressions, you spammed \"nodelist\" comments anywhere it might be related in order to promote the idea before anyone had a chance to discuss it.

There is some subtle interplay going on.\n\nIf the output is an array of objects that specify location and value, then both that format and the sequence of the items within it need to be considered when returning from an embedded path so that the remainder of the expression can handle it properly.\n\nIf embedded paths are to follow some different output that operators can then use, we need to specify what that is as well.

That is not a healthy way to run this, and maybe I was making an unwarranted assumption that this would be obvious.\r\n\r\nSo, indeed, feedback is good, but not so much about reasons wanting to eliminate/equate concepts prematurely and end the discussion about them before understanding them, but more about the properties of the concept itself.  The fact that XPath arrived at a specific form of nodelist after trying nodesets is certainly interesting feedback.  We may not need that complexity, but it is much easier to eliminate complexity once we understand the concepts.",

Let me explain why with an example.\r\n\r\nTake the input argument:\r\n```\r\n{ \"a\": {\"c\": 0, \"d\": 1},\r\n  \"b\": {\"e\": 2, \"f\": 3}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand the selector `$.*.*`.\r\n\r\nI think the valid outputs should be:\r\n* `[0, 1, 2, 3]`\r\n* `[0, 1, 3, 2]`\r\n* `[1, 0, 2, 3]`\r\n* `[1, 0, 3, 2]`\r\n* `[2, 3, 0, 1]`\r\n* `[2, 3, 1, 0]`\r\n* `[3, 2, 0, 1]`\r\n* `[3, 2, 1, 0]`\r\n\r\nBut I think the following output, for example, should be invalid:\r\n* `[0, 2, 1, 3]`\r\n\r\nThe spec should allow for this level of non-determinism, but not more.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the Compliance Test Suite covers this example, it should allow precisely the valid outputs to pass.

JSON out.\r\n* JSON arrays are ordered by nature, which might falsy signal determinism of results.\r\n* So calling the result a \"node-list\" might help here out, but introduces another level of complexity in terms and their usage.\r\n\r\nHaving understood, that determinism is solely required for compliance testing, I am not sure, how to interprete Glyn's example above. Should future compliance tests really tell about every possible valid and invalid result ordering? \r\n\r\nI am sure someone of us would be able to implement something, exactly reproducing `[0, 2, 1, 3]` as result (noone would of course). Thus it's implementation dependent.\r\n\r\nBut if we only need to insure, to always generate a single reproducable result, we can achieve this by something like ...\r\n\r\n1.

Generate the list of values from that path list &ndash; preserving order.\r\n\r\n... which we can even communicate in the draft as a recipe.\r\n\r\nRegarding \"node-list\", there is indeed in JavaScript a concept of \"array-like objects\". Those objects only need to be able to tell the list length and provide an iterator to visit all entries. Defacto dom node-lists are exactly such things.

Then `$.a-b` and `$['a-b']` would be synonyms, but `$.a.b` and `$['a.b']` wouldn't.\r\n*(Tim Bray)*\r\n\r\nHmm ... this seems to be a hint to better exclude `'-'` from dot-child-selector syntax. I think I have read more discussion about that, currently don't know where.\r\n",

          "body": "Filter expressions `[?(<expr>)]` are completely missing in the current draft.\r\n\r\nImplementations agree, that filter expressions are an essential feature with JSONPath. They are considered much more important than \"index expressions\" `[(<expr>)]`, given that term \"index\" is an interim synonym for \"name / index\" ([#84](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/84#issuecomment-809245242)).\r\n\r\nThere are already some discussions about filters (historically ascending):\r\n\r\n* Non-property-name-friendly chars [#16](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/16)\r\n* Query expression language support [#17](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/17)\r\n* Treating of duplicates [#23](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/23)\r\n* Security items [#25](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/25)\r\n* Filter applied to JSON object [#47](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/47)\r\n* Some observations on the 3 March 2021 draft [#56](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/56)\r\n* JSONPath expression and bracket-notation [#57](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/57)\r\n* Regular expressions in filters [#70](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/70)\r\n* The problem of comparing an evaluated expression with a json literal [#74](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/74)\r\n* The \"current value\" or \"current node\", and the meaning thereof [#76](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/76)\r\n\r\n## 1. Term \"filter expression\"\r\n\r\nThe WG still has to decide, if we want to use the term \"filter expression\" in the draft, as there are some objections against it ([#20](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/20#issue-707818524)).\r\n\r\nAs an alternative the term \"filter selector\" was proposed, which is used below.\r\n\r\n## 2. Apply Filter Selector to Objects\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no agreement, if filters should be applied to objects ([#47](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/47)).\r\n\r\nConsider a school,\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"students\": [...],\r\n    \"staff\": [...],\r\n    \"teachers\": [...]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhile looking for the array(s) containing persons named 'M\u00fcller' by `'$[?(@..name == 'M\u00fcller')]'`, which is not the same as looking for the persons themself by `'$.*[?(@.name == 'M\u00fcller')]'`.\r\n\r\nI can see value for allowing filter selectors applied to objects and not really a rational reason to exclude them from filtering.\r\n\r\n## 3. How Filter Selectors Work\r\n\r\nFilter selectors work via iterating over arrays and objects, provided the latter is allowed by the spec. \r\n\r\n### 3.1 Selecting\r\n\r\nDuring iteration process the value of each array element or object member is taken and evaluated against an implicite boolean expression `<expr>` in `'[?(<expr)]'`. If the result is *truthy*, the item is selected. In case of a *falsy* result, it is not.\r\n\r\n### 3.2 The Current Value `@`\r\n\r\nIn expression `<expr>`, the special selector `'@'` represents the currently visited JSON value during iteration process. The most simple JSONPath expression with a filter selector is `'$[?(@)]'`, collecting all items of the related container, provided their individual value is interpreted as truthy.\r\n\r\nSpecial selector `'@'` used outside of filter selectors may have completely different meaning.\r\n\r\n## 4. Syntax\r\n\r\n### 4.1 Filter Selector Syntax\r\n\r\n```abnf\r\nfilter-selector    = \"[?(\" expr \")]\"\r\n```\r\nThere are some discussions / implementations that are leaving out the parentheses. In this case syntax reads:\r\n\r\n```abnf\r\nfilter-selector    = \"[?\" expr \"]\"\r\n```\r\nIt needs to be discussed, if the last - more minimally - syntax works in all practical cases. If it does and `expr` is allowed to contain parentheses, above original syntax would be also valid automatically.\r\n\r\n### 4.2 Filter Selector Expression Syntax\r\n\r\nImplicite boolean expression `expr` is evaluated and converted to the JSON values `true` or `false`. Selection occures in the `true` case only.\r\n\r\nGreg proposes a minimal set of basic comparison, mathematical, and boolean operators [#17](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/17):\r\n\r\n```\r\n==   equal\r\n!=   not equal\r\n<    less than\r\n<=   less than or equal to\r\n>    greater than\r\n>=   greater than or equal to\r\n\r\n+    addition\r\n-    subtraction\r\n*    multiplication\r\n/    division\r\n%    modulus\r\n\r\n&&   and\r\n||   or\r\n```\r\n\r\nTaking this set of operators, excluding arithmetic operators for now, we have something like this:\r\n\r\n```abnf\r\nexpr                = *comparisons\r\ncomparisons         = [\"(\"] comparison *[logical-operator comparison] [\")\"]\r\nlogical-operator    = \"||\" / \"&&\"\r\ncomparison          = relative-path [comparison-operator value]\r\ncomparison-operator = \"==\" / \"!=\" / \"<\" / \">\" / \"<=\" / \">=\"\r\nvalue               = number / quoted-string / true / false / null\r\nrelative-path       = \"@\" *(dot-selector / index-selector)\r\n```\r\n`dot-selector` and `index-selector` is defined elsewhere. `number`, `quoted-string` and `null` is defined analog to RFC8259.\r\n\r\n### 4.3 Arithmetic operator Extension\r\n\r\nTwo scenarios for using (binary) arithmetic operators `op` are possible.\r\n\r\n1. Use it on the left side of the comparison, i.e. `'relativ-path op (relativ-path | number)'`. Here it is implied, that values on both sides of the comparison are of type `number`. If one or both are `string` or `null` it must be decided, what to do.\r\n2. Use it on the right side of the comparison is a trivial thing for number literals and might be directly replaced by its arithmetic result.\r\n\r\nI can hardly see relevant practical use cases here and would opt for not supporting arithmetic operators at the first glance.\r\n\r\n### 4.4 `in` operator Extension\r\n\r\nAn `in` operator might be useful. Examples are\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[?(@.color in ['red','green','blue'])]\r\n[?(@.type in [1,2,4,8])]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn fact, supporting this would be pure syntactic sugar, as it can always be replaced by\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[?(@.color == 'red' || @.color == 'green' || @.color == 'blue')]\r\n[?(@.type == 1 || @.type == 2 || @.type == 4 || @.type == 8)]\r\n```\r\nWhats your opinion? With minimalism in mind I would opt against it.\r\n\r\n### 4.5 Nested Filter Selectors\r\n\r\nGreg pointed us to an [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67017189/jsonpath-can-not-get-the-needed-value-using-expressions). Herein an array element (an object itself) is to be selected, if and only if its subarray property contains an element having a certain index/value pair. Somewhat like\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$.arr[?(@.type == 'a' && @.subarr[?(@.prop == 'b')])]\r\n```\r\nIn this case `relative-path` in 4.2 above should be modified to\r\n\r\n```abnf\r\nrelative-path = \"@\" *(dot-selector / index-selector / filter-selector)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat's the general opinion here ?\r\n\r\n### 4.6 Regular expressions with Filter Selectors\r\n\r\nSee [Regular expressions in filters #70](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/70).\r\n\r\nI see usefulness here.\r\n",

This leaves the single `@` to denote the initial interated scope.  I can't imagine this would be used much, and maybe we include this functionality with a SHOULD or RECOMMENDED so that it's not a hard requirement, which will alleviate pressure on implementors.",

I also think that it should support index queries.\n\nHowever, I recognize that it says _nothing at all_ in regard to expressions currently, and I'm on board with getting _something_ in place to cover the things we at least agree on right now so long as it's done in a way to leave the door open to incorporate these other features after we've discussed them further.",

But in JSON we don't really have anything like that. I don't find it natural to think about a \"tree of nodes\" in the context of JSONPath. The implementations I know about don't have a tree, they don't identify location by the position in a tree, rather, they operate on path/value pairs.\r\n\r\nFor example, looking at the slice operator code in [David Chester's Node.js implementation](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath/)\r\n```\r\n'subscript-child-slice': function(component, partial) {\r\n    if (is_array(partial.value)) {\r\n      var args = component.expression.value.split(':').map(_parse_nullable_int);\r\n      var values = partial.value.map(function(v, i) { return { value: v, path: partial.path.concat(i) } });\r\n      return slice.apply(null, [values].concat(args));\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nthere is no tree, just a selected value and an updated path.

What else does it hold?\r\n\r\n- Does a node provide access to its parent node, like a DOM Node does?\r\n- Does a node provide access to its associated key, or index?\r\n\r\nQuestion 2: How do we interpret \"root node which _is_ the input document\"\r\n\r\nThe term \"input document\", is that a real thing? Actual JSON data? No nodes?\r\n\r\nDoes the draft really mean that the root node _is_ the input document?

It's a hierarchy of values, not nodes that _contain_ values.\r\n\r\nA JSON value can be considered as a tree of nodes. A JSON literal corresponds to a single node with value equal to the literal. A sequence corresponds to a node whose children (indexed by position in the sequence) correspond to the values of the sequence. An object corresponds to a node whose children (indexed by name in the object) correspond to the values of the object.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> What are the properties of a node? We're told it holds a JSON value.

For sequences or objects, the node holds just the number of children or their names, respectively.\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     * Does a node provide access to its parent node, like a DOM Node does?\r\n\r\nEvery node except the root node _has_ a parent.

It's meaningless to talk about an abstraction without enumerating their properties, much as it would be meaningless to talk about an Abelian Group or a Hilbert Space without enumerating their properties. So I think asking whether a node supports a property \"parent\" is meaningful. My own view is that it would be helpful to define \"node\" succinctly in the terminology section, with its properties briefly mentioned.  Then those properties can be referred to later in the draft when specifying how to go from a node to a Normalized Path or an item. \r\n\r\nI don't think its necessary to talk about a \"tree of nodes\", which is a less abstract concept; it is enough to define node, and identify its properties. \"tree of nodes\" suggests an arrangement of data that is never found in actual implementations, \"node\" by itself doesn't have that connotation. It's properties are all that matter.",

I note that the consensus is [duplicates allowed](https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/results/union_with_duplication_from_array.html) (32 out of 41 implementations); with duplicates, there are issues with identity, but without, there are not.  \r\n\r\nNow consider the evaluation of a JSON document that produces a JSON array of Normalized Paths,\r\n\r\nJSON = jsonPath(JSON, JSONPath-expression, path-option)\r\n\r\nIn terms of the processing model, in the case of duplicates allowed, not much is different, except that in addition to selecting a value at each step, a corresponding path needs to be accumulated. The paths are simply accumulated, we don't do anything with them, we compute them along with the values, and we return a JSON array of them. At every step, the \"current value\" corresponds to an accumulated path, these two exist as a pair, so I think it makes sense to refer to that pair as a \"node\". \r\n\r\nIn the output, a path will be represented as a \"string\". In the processing model, it need not be, we can talk about a \"context position\" if you like, but conceptually it's a path.\r\n\r\nFor either the value or path option, it's in the minority position of \"no duplicates\" that things become interesting, where identity matters.

[This](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel-31/#Node) is what \"node\" means in XPath 3.1, but what does it mean in JSONPath? It is meaningless to talk about \"node\" unless \"node\" is defined, and its properties enumerated, as they are in the XPath 3.1 reference. I think terms are being introduced into the draft that are suggestive of terms in XPath, such as \"item\" and \"node\", but surely the one thing that we can all agree on is that we do _not_ want the JSONPath spec to look anything like XPath, with its horrendously complicated data model. \r\n\r\nIt's also unnecessary to introduce \"node\" to fully describe JSONPath, including selection of values or references from a root value with duplicates, selection of Normalized Paths from a root value with duplicates, and both of these operations without duplicates (when identity matters.) It is enough to have the notion of path/value pairs, where \"path\" describes the location of the value in the root value. Nothing else is needed.\r\n\r\nDaniel\r\n\r\n",

But it was an interesting discussion, given that JSONPointer and Normalized Path both serve to identify a specific value in a JSON document.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, in the world outside of JSONPath, nobody cares about Normalized Paths, JSONPointer is ubiquitous, and a foundation for other tooling. But within the world of JSONPath, when we perform a JSONPath query with \"Normalized Path\" option specified, we need to get back paths that JSONPath knows about, and that work if they're used as paths in queries. It's a shame that the two syntaxes aren't compatible. But they aren't, and that's about all that an be said.    \r\n",

If we can check a query before applying it to input, we should do that with failing fast.\r\n",

If you use substitution, evaluating the path on `@..foo == 1` would result in `[1] == 1` which is wrong.  So for this case, it makes sense to _not_ allow multiple return values and always strip the array.\n\nHowever, supposing that we define functions, you could have something like `contains(@..foo, 1)` in which case, you might _want_ to allow multiple return values.\n\nBut.... Then there's an ambiguity between `@..foo` returning multiple values and it returning a single value which happens to be an array.\n\nConsidering these variants, I think it only makes sense to force the return of a single value from paths inside expressions. I just don't see a reliable way to return the full match set and still get the expressions that we want.\n\nI see this as an _implicit_ `single()` function wrapping the path, e.g. `single(@..foo) == 1` where `@..foo` returns its normal array of matches, but the `single()` ensures that it only contains one value, otherwise an error results (or, to be non-destructive, the expression evaluates to `false` so that the item is not selected).\n\nIf this `single()` function were the default behavior (implicit), we could define another function, say `all_results()`, that could be used explicitly to declare that we want the full match set so that we can operate on the result as an array.",

For advocates of \"return as single value\", whose case is represented in section 8 of  [minutes-109-jsonpath-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-109-jsonpath/), the answer is completely clear. The path evaluates to a single value, which can be compared to a JSON literal on the right hand side, and there is no issue.  \r\n\r\nHowever, for advocates of \"return as array\" (the majority), the answer is less clear, as the JSONPath Comparison examples illustrate.

So you might want to apply jsonPath to the resulting structure again or use one of your favorite array methods as sort with it.\"\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, _all_ JSONPath implementations, whether \"return as array\" or \"return as single value\", are consistent with the idea of JSON in, JSON out.

As an expression is evaluated, the value the the current node represents MUST change to reflect the node currently being evaluated. \"|\"The context item is the item currently being processed.

Because of this, an expression such as @.bar would be equivalent to just bar, so the current node is only allowed as a bare expression.\"|Sometimes explicit - `.//para` selects the para element descendants of the context node.

In Goessner JSONPath, the term \"object\" used here seems to refer to any JSON value. The term \"node\" is only used when referring to XPATH 1.\r\n<a id=\"footnote2\">2</a>.  In JMESPath, the term \"node\" is undefined, but can be considered synonymous with \"JSON value\". In JMESPath, results may be elements in the original JSON document, or newly created elements that don't exist in the JSON document, preserving paths into the original JSON document doesn't figure into it.\r\n<a id=\"footnote3\">3</a>. For XPath 3.1, \"node\" is defined in the [XQuery and XPath Data Model 3.1 W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel-31/#Node). Among other properties, each node must have a unique identity, distinct from all others. Element nodes have a property children and a property parent, possibly empty.\r\n<a id=\"footnote4\">4</a>. In this JMESPath expression, `foo` is understood to mean `@.foo`, and `bar` is understood to mean `@.bar`. The only place where the symbol `@` is used explicitly is as a \"bare expression\", as shown in the argument to the `count` function.\r\n\r\n\"current object\" in Goessner JSONPath as represented by `@` is clearly underspecified, but can easily be understood in the more general sense in JMESPath, as \"the node currently being evaluated\", or in XPath 3.1, as \" the item currently being processed\".\r\n\r\nThe Goessner examples:\r\n```\r\n$.store.book[(@.length-1)].title                   (1)\r\n\r\n$.store.book[?(@.price < 10)].title               (2)\r\n```\r\nare fully consistent with the more general sense. In (1), the \"current value\" @ represents the array `$.store.book`, in (2), the `?` connotes iteration over the array, and `@` represents an array element.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it's natural to generalize that at `$`, the current value `@` represents the JSON document; at `$.store`, it represents the result of evaluating `$.store`, and so on.\r\n",

      "body": "(Co-chair hat off)\r\n\r\nThis is related to #63 (\"Respect Implementations\").  I think it will help us if we think about what we want the output of our work to be.  It is a fact that there are lots of implementations, that they are incompatible in places, and that few of them are likely to change as a result of us publishing an RFC.  Given that, what are reasonable goals for our work bearing our charter in mind?\r\n\r\nFirst, provide a formal, readable, and helpful specification of JSONPath syntax as it exists.  To the extent that there is \"consensus\" (a matter of judgment, not voting) we can use MUST here.   If we encounter a case where there are broad divergences in with more than 1 in widespread use, we make a judgment call which to describe - it's OK to describe more than one option - and possible to use SHOULD.  For example, there are a significant number of implementations that support initial \"@\" and so we should describe that syntax.\r\n\r\nSecond, provide interoperability guidance (one of my favorite parts of 8259).  For example, for interoperability, users SHOULD avoid JSONPaths with initial \"@\".  Another example: they SHOULD prefer bracket notation to dot notation so they don't have to worry about selectors with hyphens in them.  I suspect there are lots of other opportunities to do this usefully.\r\n\r\nThird, provide lots and lots of examples.  For every fragment of syntax, offer examples. There are a few sections that lack this currently.\r\n\r\nFourth (maybe not possible) find a way to include (if only by reference) the existing work from Glyn and cburgmer which provides concrete data about expected inputs and outputs, and variations observed in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "When I was faced with using JSONPath for the first time, it required guesswork and experimentation because the implementation concerned was essentially undocumented. Guesswork and experimentation can lead to dependency on unintended or unstable behaviour. This was not satisfactory. Also, any bug fixing of the implementation in the absence of a specification would not necessarily lead to convergence. One benefit of an RFC would be to clearly specify (common) behaviour of JSONPath such that implementations could either migrate to supporting that behaviour or, failing that, could at least document which standard behaviours they support and how they deviate from standard behaviour. Given a RFC and supposing the implementation I was using was still undocumented, I would have performed experiments on the implementation to see which standard behaviours it supported. I could even have contributed the results to form partial documentation since the implementation was open source.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when I had to implement JSONPath, I found it was necessary to come up with my own specification of syntax and semantics. @cburgmer's comparison project gave me a consensus to aim for, but outside that consensus, there was a lot of latitude and I had to make several policy decisions which, being relatively new to JSONPath, I wasn't certain about. If an RFC had existed, I would have tried to implement it, or at least a subset.\r\n\r\nSo, for me, it is more important that a RFC provide a clear and unambiguous specification of common behaviour of JSONPath rather than necessarily exploring features provided by a minority of implementations. I'm certainly not looking for innovation or new features to be added to JSONPath by a RFC because I want to encourage implementations to (slowly) migrate towards standard behaviour over time and I'd like to minimise the cost of developing new implementations. Also, from a usability point of view, I think \"less is more\", so it's important to keep the scope of the RFC fairly small to avoid producing a large, and potentially unreadable, document.",

For example, you mentioned re2, but it is not widely available and I'm not even sure if any implementation is actually using it.\r\n\r\n@glyn:\r\n> Also, from a usability point of view, I think \"less is more\", so it's important to keep the scope of the RFC fairly small to avoid producing a large, and potentially unreadable, document.\r\n\r\nSo for instance your point of view is again against regex, according to #70 there is a lot of specification work (and a lot of text needs to be written).\r\n\r\nI think that regex are useful, but do we wish excluding them?\r\n\r\nI don't think so, I think that we need a different attitude if we want standardize something useful. I believe that there is a number of topics that will run into the same kind of problems, if we stick to this idea.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,\r\n\r\n@glyn:\r\n> So, for me, it is more important that a RFC provide a clear and unambiguous specification of common behaviour of JSONPath rather than necessarily exploring features provided by a minority of implementations. I'm certainly not looking for innovation or new features to be added to JSONPath by a RFC\r\n\r\nIs your point of view compatible with our charter?\r\n\r\nThe draft charter was:\r\n> The WG will develop a standards-track JSONPath specification, with\r\n> the primary goal of capturing the common semantics of existing\r\n> implementations and, where there are differences, choosing\r\n> semantics with the goal of causing the least disruption among\r\n> JSONPath users.\r\n\r\nI will quote Barry Leiba, that asked to change it:\r\n> I fear that this text appears to say that we primarily want to develop a\r\n> dumbed-down compromise mush, and I'm sure that's not what we really mean.  The\r\n> *primary* goal is, surely, to develop a specification for JSONPath that is\r\n> technically sound, complete, and useful.\r\n\r\nAnd the following has been proposed:\r\n> The WG will develop a standards-track JSONPath specification that\r\n> is technically sound and complete, based on the common semantics\r\n> and other aspects of existing implementations.  Where there are\r\n> differences, the working group will analyze those differences and\r\n> make choices that rough consensus considers technically best, with\r\n> an aim toward minimizing disruption among the different JSONPath\r\n> implementations.\r\n     \r\nHonestly, I think that your point of view (which I quoted before) is *not compatible* with the aim of the charter.\r\n\r\nI wish we succeed in writing and standardizing a feature rich (e.g. which may include regex and other features), that is valuable for users (again users need features) \r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that if we standardize something interesting, users will prefer this to the legacy implementations.\r\n\r\nOf course we need to stay coherent with our core values, that are described in Goessner's article, but this is not in contradiction with reasonable adjustments, polishing and additions (such as regex) to it.\r\n\r\nSome disruptions will happen anyway (we need to make a choice about filters at a certain point, and we are going to define a DSL for them), but it will happen for a reason.\r\n\r\nI also wish you understand that deferring difficult choices is not helpful, maybe we rather need to discuss them as soon as possible. We don't need writing the spec for all of them right now, but we need to discuss and check consensus for several of them as soon as possible so we don't waste precious time.\r\n\r\nAnyway if your plan is just mapping the status quo and writing a document about a common interoperable subset, I think that might be useful for some users, however it sounds to me  quite sterile (and I'm not interested to spend my time on it) and I think that there isn't any need of a standard or a discussion on it for just gathering facts about existing implementations.\r\n\r\n@timbray I acknowledge that you are a heavy JSONPath user and you don't want to see useless disruptions, my aim is to avoid them too, but we also need  to acknowledge that some disruptions may happen (e.g. no one is going to replace `$.foo` with `\u20ac.foo` ;) ).\r\n",

My implementation already doesn't support multiple indices of any kind, so adding this concept at all \"breaks\" my implementation, according to the above scenarios.\r\n\r\nIs this really a break though?  The spec has required something that my implementation doesn't support.  But I never claimed to be in compliance with the spec.  I couldn't have claimed that because the spec didn't exist when I published the library.  That means that the spec could _completely overhaul_ the syntax, and my implementation wouldn't break.  It still adheres to what it claims to.  That someone published a document that says \"this is what JSON Path is now\" doesn't change what my implementation claims to support.\r\n\r\nConsider my JSON Schema library.  It claims to support drafts 6 through 2020-12 (we had a version scheme change a bit ago).  When the next draft is published, probably draft 2021-_something_, my implementation will still be in compliance with what it claims.  It doesn't claim to support the new draft, and the draft's mere existence doesn't break anything in my implementation.\r\n\r\nNow, if I want to be able to claim compliance to this new JSON Path spec, I'll need to make updates, and I'm fine with that.  It makes sense that I would have to.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't think that we can create a specification that won't break anyone (without making it uselessly simplistic) or to which any single implementation will be able to claim compliance without having to update _something_.\r\n\r\nImplementations should expect to have to change in order to comply with this new specification.\r\n\r\nI think this is the line of thought that we need to take when we consider what a breaking change is.  We can try to minimize that impact as much as possible, but we're not going to be able to eliminate it.\r\n\r\nTherefore I think we need to put less weight on the idea of not \"breaking\" implementations because they're going to need updates, regardless of what we do.\r\n",

          "body": "> What constitutes \"breaking\" an implementation?\r\n\r\nI think that breaking for us means turning existing valid expresions for a certain implementation invalid from the RFC point of view (or changing their behavior). So the implementation will have to decide whether comply with the new RFC or invalidating already existing user expresions.\r\n\r\ne.g. changing `$.foo` in `\u00a3.foo` is breaking, accepting also `@.bar` as an addition (while also accepting `$.foo` with no changes to it) is not breaking. \r\n\r\nAvoiding changing code is not a point. This is going to happen, otherwise it means that our job here is mostly useless.\r\nFrom my point of view my users are more important than my code.\r\n\r\n> Adding something to the spec that an implementation doesn't support?\r\n\r\nnot breaking\r\n\r\n> Not including something that an implementation already supports?\r\n\r\nbreaking, but it may allow some kind of legacy additional features with a reasonable effort. It might not work in certain situations.\r\n\r\n> Defining the behavior of a supported syntax in a way different to the implementation?\r\n\r\nbreaking and requires user knowledge about the change.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Is this really a break though?

That someone published a document that says \"this is what JSON Path is now\" doesn't change what my implementation claims to support.\r\n\r\nThis is a good argument.

      "body": "Consider following JSON value ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"v\",\r\n  \"a\": { \"u\": [1,2], \"v\": [3,4] },\r\n  \"b\": { \"u\": [11,12], \"v\": [13,14] },\r\n  \"c\": [ [21,22], [23,24] ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### 1. Basic Usage\r\n\r\n* JSONPath allows alternate names or array indices as a set.\r\n* Names or indices refer to their immediate parent object or array.\r\n\r\nExamples are ...\r\n\r\n| expression | result |\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|`$['a','b'].u`| `[[1,2],[11,12]]` |\r\n|`$.c[0,1]`| `[[21,22],[23,24]]` |\r\n|`$.a..['u',1]`| `[[1,2],2,4]` |\r\n\r\n### 2. Unions are Syntactic Sugar\r\n\r\nExample expressions above can easily be singularized, i.e.\r\n\r\n| union expression | singularized expressions |\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|`$['a','b'].u`| `$['a'].u \\| $['b'].u` |\r\n|`$.c[0,1]`| `$.c[0] \\| $.c[1]` |\r\n|`$.a..['u',1]`| `$.a..['u'] \\| $.a..[1]` |\r\n\r\nusing XPath operator `|` for `or`.   \r\nSo if all union expressions are only syntactic sugar, why do they exist? Possible answers are:\r\n\r\n* Sparing key strokes.\r\n* Better performance.\r\n\r\nLast point is the more serious one. Only implementors can show individually, if processing union expressions is more performant than multiple invocations of their JSONPath command / function with singularized expressions or otherwise round.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is motivation enough to slightly change the spec from\r\n\r\n> An implementation of this specification, from now on referred to\r\n   simply as \"an implementation\", SHOULD takes two inputs, **a JSONPath**\r\n   and a JSON value, and produce ...\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n> An implementation of this specification, from now on referred to\r\n   simply as \"an implementation\", SHOULD takes two inputs, **a single JSONPath or a list of JSONPath queries**\r\n   and a JSON value, and produce ...\r\n\r\nin order to allow implementors applying a list of queries to a JSON value and thus improving their performance.\r\n\r\n### 3. Duplicates and Ordering\r\n\r\nAccepting equivalence of an union expression and its set of singularized expressions according to Ch.2, neither duplicates nor ordering needs to be discussed anymore with unions, since\r\n\r\n* `$[0,0]` yields the same result as `$[0] | $[0]`, which is obviously twice the same value.\r\n* `$[1,2]` should yield the same result as `$[1] | $[2]`. Exact order might still be not deterministic.\r\n\r\n### 4. Variable Expressions\r\n\r\nI know only a handful examples using the root selector, which are of practicle value. One of them is internal referencing ala `$.a[($.id)] === $.a['v'] => [[3,4]]`. Examples with the current node selector are questionable at best, like `$.a.u[(@[0])] === $.a.u[1] => [2]`.\r\n\r\nResults of those expressions are always interpreted as names or indices (JSON literals string and number) according to the nature of their parents.\r\n\r\nNow there are rising some questions regarding this:\r\n\r\n* Do we allow those expressions, despite comments say, that their practical value is quite low.\r\n* If we do, wouldn't it be safe &ndash; as also proposed &ndash; to leave out the parenthesis, giving: `$.a[$.id]` and `$.a.u[@[0]]`.\r\n* If we allow, how to deal with nesting ... `$.a[@.u[@[0]]]` ?\r\n* If we do, it might be consequent to also allow that with unions, as in `$.a['u',$.id]`?\r\n\r\n### 5. Path Expressions\r\n\r\n@danielaparker linked to an interesting [discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55497833/jsonpath-union-of-multiple-different-paths) regarding unions containing paths, as in `$..[id,a.u]` wanting to get `$.id | $.a.u`. Applying singularization principle yields\r\n\r\n* `$..[id]` ... ok, if `'id'` was used.\r\n* `$..[a.u]` ... nonsense, since `$.a.u` was meant.\r\n\r\nUsing `$..['id',@.a.u]` according to Ch.4 is completely different. \r\n\r\n### 6. Resumee\r\n\r\n1. Union expressions can always be replaced by a set of singularized expressions.\r\n2. So union expressions might become obsolete, while propagating parallel evaluation of multiple query expressions.\r\n3. I propose to support union expressions for historical reasons and allow string or number literals exclusively.\r\n4. If variable expressions are allowed, only the root selector should be used. Current node selector as well as nested expression are disallowed.\r\n5. Unions shouldn't be first class citizens.\r\n\r\nI simply took the term \"union\" from XPath 1.0. Now I also agree with most of others here, that \"union\" should be replaced by a better term.\r\n\r\n",

Unions shouldn't be first class citizens.\r\n> \r\nI don't agree with the conclusion because the notational convenience of unions has value, the convenience of not having to repeat the first part of the path is significant, especially with combinations such as in [@cabo's example](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/88#issuecomment-808362881). I don't think the performance concerns are as important, singularized expression evaluation can be optimized, and unions can also execute in parallel. Although with wildcards in the path, I think the edge goes to unions.\r\n\r\nBut I think this way of looking at the problem is helpful, because it suggests what the allowed items in a union expression should be. The proposal notes that union expressions can always be replaced by a set of singularized expressions. If conversely we require that a  a set of singularized expressions can always be replaced by a single expression with unions, it suggests that the allowed items in a union should include all of indices, identifiers, slices, wildcards, and relative path expressions beginning with `@`.\r\n\r\nFor example, given the root value,\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n          \"firstName\": \"John\",\r\n          \"lastName\" : \"doe\",\r\n          \"age\"      : 26,\r\n          \"address\"  : {\r\n            \"streetAddress\": \"naist street\",\r\n            \"city\"         : \"Nara\",\r\n            \"postalCode\"   : \"630-0192\"\r\n          }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand single expressions\r\n```\r\n$..'firstName'\r\n$..address.city\r\n```\r\nthe result would be\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    \"John\",\r\n    \"Nara\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\nA corresponding expression with unions could be\r\n```\r\n$..['firstName',@.address.city]\r\n```\r\nand the result would be the same.\r\n\r\nAn alternative equivalent union would be\r\n```\r\n$[@..'firstName',@..address.city]\r\n```\r\nwhich suggests that a convenient way to provide a set of singular paths is through a union.\r\n\r\nThis understanding of unions is supported in the [jsoncons](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons/blob/master/doc/ref/jsonpath/jsonpath.md) implementation, and its author thinks it's a natural generalization of the union concept. \"Variable Expressions\" don't really fit into this dual view (although the jsoncons implementation supports them with the parentheses providing disambiguation). Personally, I think \"Variable Expressions\" could be dropped, or kept for historical reasons only.\r\n\r\nDaniel ",

I think the existing union notation is fine. I'm only suggesting that `$.a..('u' | 1)` would be the equivalent JSONPath notation if JSONPath did support the | operator in the same way as XPath, and you mentioned both in your comment. \r\n\r\nOn [this point](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/88#issuecomment-808522662), there would be no break to existing implementations, it would be a generalization only.",

I think @goessner's thoughts about the equivalence of  an | operator and a union provide additional motivation if interpreted in the right way, meaning the way in which I want them to be interpreted :-)\r\n\r\nThere are a few implementations in JSONPath comparisons that support [an example of this](https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/results/bracket_notation_with_two_literals_separated_by_dot.html) but without the leading '@'.

I think I would prefer `$..['firstName','city']`, though it doesn't do quite the same thing since yours looks specfically for `address.city`. We should probably take this syntax to another issue.\r\n> \r\nI think the issue here is with the bracket notation being overloaded in JSONPath for both indexes, on the one hand, and XPath style unions, on the other. For \"indexes\" interpreted broadly, it's natural to restrict to numbers, slices and wildcards, and perhaps identifiers. For unions, it's natural to allow paths, as XPath does.  \r\n\r\nJMESPath also uses brackets for both indices and multi-select-list (analogous to unions), but in the grammar distinguishes between them. It distinguishes between a bracket specifier, with one element,\r\n```\r\nbracket-specifier = \"[\" (number / \"*\" / slice-expression) \"]\" / \"[]\"\r\nbracket-specifier =/ \"[?\" expression \"]\" ; analogous to JSONPath filter\r\n```\r\nand a multi-select-list, which only allows comma separated expressions (paths). In JMESPath, identifiers cannot start with a number, so there is no ambiguity.\r\n\r\nBut even without that grammatical distinction, there would be no ambiguity to allow both indexes and paths as union elements in JSONPath unions.\r\n\r\nThe reason for raising this in this issue is that it fits naturally with @goessner's discussion about the equivalence of the 'or' operator and unions, and clearly in the `or` operator paths are allowed. In XPath, the 'or' operator is explicitly equivalent to the union, and any union can be replaced anywhere in the path by an equivalent `or` operator, with parenthesis.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "This discussion branches off of #88 primarily but the idea has also been discussed elsewhere (#17 & #57).\n\nThis issue covers the parenthetical bracket notation without the `?`, e.g. `$[(<expr>)]`.  Specifically, what is `<expr>` and what does this syntax do?\n\nThere have been many references to confusion and questions of usefulness regarding this syntax.  But I think this is a syntax that is underutilized due to lack of understanding.\n\n## Explanation by way of JSON Schema\n\nIn JSON Schema, there have been many discussions around the idea of comparing instance data against other instance data.  You can perform a search for \"$data\" on the schema spec site to read up on this, but I'll summarize.\n\nSuppose we have these instances:\n\n```json\n// valid\n{ \"value\": 5, \"lower-bound\": 3 }\n\n// invalid\n{ \"value\": 5, \"lower-bound\": 10 }\n```\n\nWith Schema in its current state, we can't validate these.  That's what the proposed `$data` keyword was supposed to solve.  It would provide a mechanism to reference other data for use in other keywords.  In this example, it could use the value in `lower-bound` for the `minimum` keyword.\n\nIt was never adopted, however, because no one could figure out how to make it work within the existing mechanisms of JSON Schema. (Beside the point.)\n\n(It's also similar to how `discriminator` works in the OpenAPI 3.1 specification.)\n\n## Back to JSON Path\n\nI think this operation is quite useful in that it allows the path author to use data within the Argument.\n\nLet's look at an example path: `$.x[($.id)]`.\n\nThis, to me, says select the value at `$.id`.  So long as this value contains a valid index, this should evaluate.  We have different cases.\n\n(Sorry, I can't make a pretty table as I'm on mobile.)\n\n- `{ \"id\": 2, \"x\": [ 5, 10, 15 ] }` -> `[15]`\n- `{ \u201did\": \"foo\", \"x\": { \"foo\": 10, \"bar\": 15 } }` -> `[10]`\n\nMaybe even this could be supported, though we run into \"interpretation\" issues of converting a string into something more meaningful to us.\n\n- `{ \"id\": \"0:1\", \"x\": [ 5, 10, 15 ] }` -> `[5, 10]`\n\nI don't think that it make sense for `$.id` to contain a union, only a single index.\n\nI think that if people understood this functionality better, it might get more usage.  Path authors could devise some fairly complex queries that couldn't otherwise be built.  I think this syntax _with this function_ is worth including.\n\nNote that I'm also setting aside the more common `$[(@.length-1)]` because we don't have a clear direction on \"inherent\" properties or functions.  As I've defined it here, this expression would look for a `length` key and expect a number as its value then subtract one from that to get the index to select.\n\n---\n\nYou may have noticed that I didn't put a `@` in that path above. This is because it results in a narrower set of cases.  I'd like to explore that now to prove my point.\n\n`$.x[@.id]` would look for an `id` key in the value at `$.x`, which means that it would expect `$.x` to be an object.  It doesn't make sense for the value at `$.x.id` to be a number because objects can't index this way.\n\nHowever if `$.x.id` is a string, then we could select the value of that key under `$.x` without any problem.",

I'm using an example from the JSON Schema spec work (where I've been very active for the past seven years) to illustrate the usefulness of a similar feature here, where we _select_ data.  I'm fully aware of what JSON Path does.\n\n> only number or string indices must result in order to make sense.\n\nYes.  That's okay.  If the value isn't a number or a string, then the result is an empty nodelist.  Authors will understand the limitations here.\n\n> `@` will have another meaning compared to filters. This will confuse users.\n\nNo, it won't confuse users.\n\nThis is okay, too, since it has a different _context_.  The meaning is similar enough between the two contexts that it makes sense to reuse the operator.\n\nIn the context of `[?()]`, which iterates over the children of the current node, the `@` represents each child.\n\nIn the context of `[()]`, _there is no iteration of the current node_, so the `@` can only mean the current node itself.\n\n> I cannot see another striking use case beside \"internal referencing\"\n\nThat's it. The entire feature.  There's nothing more to it.  But it opens up selection mechanisms that can't otherwise be achieved.\n\n> If we once allow the use of $ and @ with [()] we will have everything\n\nYes. And we want everything.  I want an author to be able to say \"select the node before the index indicated by the value in `$.foo`.\"  That would be `$[($.foo-1)]`.  If `$.foo` doesn't contain a number, then the expression doesn't make sense and no nodes are returned.\n\n---\n\nWe agree that `$[(@.length-1)]` is useless and redundant.\n\nThis proposal redefines and expands the `[()]` syntax.\n\nIf it makes you feel better, we can have some other symbol to signify this, like `#`, e.g. `$[#()]`.

Given the descendants operator PR https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/pull/102 isn't yet merged, I'll start with an issue to capture discussion and avoid rebasing effort.\r\n\r\nWe probably don't want to _force_ any determinism on implementations, so the idea is to provide a recommendation for implementations which want to provide partial determinism and use \"SHOULD\" language so the recommendation is optional. Then implementations which opt in will agree on the ordering recommentations.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of partial determinism are:\r\n* improved predictability and interoperation\r\n* relative ease for JSONPath users writing tests, as there are fewer possible outputs.\r\n\r\nIn PR https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/pull/102 there are no constraints on the non-determinism of the descendants operator:\r\n> The `descendant-selector` is inspired by ECMAScript for XML (E4X). It selects the node and all its descendants.\r\n\r\nWe agreed in issue https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/60 to allow non-determinism in the order in which objects are iterated and the same should be true when the descendants operator encounters an object. But there are other details of the ordering which could be tied down:\r\n* arrays SHOULD be visited in array order\r\n* nodes SHOULD be visited strictly before their descendants (so-called _pre-order_ traversal).\r\n\r\n(_Post-order_ traversal, in which nodes are visited strictly after their descendants, would be an equally valid alternative.)\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons given at today's meeting for allowing full non-determinism was for parallel processing, so it would be interesting to discuss what constraints the above rules produce on parallel processing. The order of collection of the results seems to be more significant than whether or not parallel processing is used.",

      "body": "First of all, thanks for the standardization efforts!\r\n\r\nUnless I am missing something, the current draft (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base-01) allows filtering only in the context of child selection. I understand the semantics of `[?(<predicate>)]` as follows:\r\n\r\n* we have a current list of *items* (as produced by selectors earlier on the path),\r\n* for each of the items, we examine its *subitems* - elements if it is an array, values if it is an object, none otherwise,\r\n* we evaluate `<predicate>` on each subitem (with the special selector `@` denoting the subitem),\r\n* the resulting list consists of those *subitems* for which the predicate evaluates to (something) true.\r\n\r\nThe problem I see is that there seems absolutely no way to filter the current list of *items*. In some situations, one can work around it, but sometimes not. Assume I have a value\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"a\": { \"v\": true, \"w\": true },\r\n  \"b\": { \"v\": false, \"w\": true },\r\n  \"c\": { \"v\": true, \"w\": false },\r\n  \"d\": { \"v\": true, \"w\": true }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand I would like to select those of subobjects with keys \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\" (but not \"d\") whose element \"v\" is true (i.e., the resulting list should contain `{ \"v\": true, \"w\": true }` and `{ \"v\": true, \"w\": false }`). I cannot apply the filtering at the top level, as it would include the key \"d\", I cannot apply it one level below as it would have to include \"w\", and there are no other levels.\r\n\r\nImagine that we had an independent filtering selector, say `{<predicate>}`, with the semantics of evaluating `<predicate>` on each current *item* (with `@` denoting the item) and leaving those which satisfy it (note: I am not proposing this exact syntax here, just the semantics). Then I could intuitively solve the example above with `$['a','b','c']{@.v}`.\r\n\r\n(as a side note, with the above the syntax `[?(<predicate>)]` would become equivalent to `[*]{<predicate>}`)\r\n\r\nSome implementations (jayway IIRC) actually \u201csolve\u201d the problem above by applying the filtering predicate in `[?(...)]` to *items or subitems*, apparently depending on whether the items are arrays or not. IMO following this path in the standard is a bad idea, as it can quickly become confusing (what if the list contains a mixture of arrays, objects, and primitives?).\r\n\r\nPlease, consider adding an independent filtering selector to the standard!\r\n\r\n(as another side note, binding the \u201ccurrent item\u201d `@` is currently also attached to filtering, do you think it could be worthwhile to make it independent as well?)",

Please correct my reasoning in the following:\r\n* \u201ca selector acts on each of the nodes in its input nodelist and concatenates the resultant nodelists to form the result nodelist of the selector\u201d (3.4, third paragraph) - we will thus be working with nodelists (not to be confused with arrays);\r\n* \u201cThe root selector \"$\" [...] produces as output a list consisting of one node: the argument itself.\u201d (3.4, first paragraph) - the first nodelist has one element, the node with the whole document;\r\n* \u201cA union [...] selects the concatenation of the lists (in the order of the selectors) of nodes selected by the union elements.\u201d (3.5.8.2). The nodelists for each of the indices \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" each consist of a single entry (the appropriate subobject of the root), and thus the nodelist after this selector contains these three subobjects;\r\n* \u201cDuring iteration process each array element or object member is visited and its value -- accessible via symbol \"@\" -- [...] is tested against a boolean expression\u201d (3.5.9.1, second paragraph) - for each of the three nodes in the current nodelist (root subobjects keyed by \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\"), the items bound to `@` by the filter are the *values* in the node, which are all booleans; none of them contains a member named \"v\", and thus the resulting nodelist is empty.\r\n",

However, from the point of view of pure semantics, this solution feels more like a workaround: why should I use some special function to filter on the key, when there is a dedicated \u201ccore\u201d syntax for selecting subobjects by key.\r\n\r\nAnd then, even such key-accessing function would not allow to write a path with the desired semantics of \u201cselect the whole (root) object *if* it satisfies the given predicate\u201d, as there would be no place where the initial singleton nodelist could be made into an array to be filtered.\r\n\r\nPlease note, that I am not looking for a solution to any specific problem. My actual use case needs a special JSONPath implementation anyway, so I have simply extended what is currently in the draft by independent filtering (using the `{<predicate>}` syntax). I am just very much into programming languages, and I hope my somewhat \u201cpurist\u201d remarks might help to make the standard even better.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I would be interested to learn how much the standardization effort here is (only) aimed at codifying what the existing implementations are doing, or, in another terms, how strong the requirement of backwards compatibility with *status quo* is. I see some possibilities for streamlining the semantics, but things could potentially break here and there, so I am uncertain if it even makes sense to share those here.",

For example, @goessner's original blog post mentions that expressions are to support the syntax of the environment in which that they're run (e.g. Javascript, Python, etc.).

The enability to filter during iteration against the index is inherent.\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"obj\": {\r\n        \"a\": 1,\r\n        \"b\": 2,\r\n        \"c\": 3\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nalso won't work via `$.obj[?(@ != 'd')]` or `$[?(@[*] != 'd')]` (useless anyway).\r\n\r\nWe simply have no mechanism yet to get the node-index during iteration. \r\n\r\nImagine, we had the symbol `\u00a7` for giving us the node-index instead of the node value during iteration, we could write `$.obj[?(\u00a7 != 'd')]` but not `$[?(\u00a7[*] != 'd')]` even if `\u00a7` would be so smart to resolve correctly, if it occurs at the start of a relative path. Also we probably might need to have a complement function `value` then.

This is based on prior experience with supporting functions in two JSONPath implementations (C++ and C#), one allowing for custom user defined functions, and also on prior experience with two JMESPath implementations (C++ and C#) with built in functions as per the [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#built-in-functions).\r\n\r\nI had earlier suggested `key(@)` [here](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/57#issuecomment-792857872), without fully thinking it through, but I no longer think it's a good idea. The difficulty is what that requires for the arguments passed to functions. Support for `key(@)` as a general function would require arguments to come in pairs, either `path-value` pairs or minimally `key-value` pairs. And of course not all function arguments are associated with paths. That makes for a messy function interface, departing from prior experience, prior experience suggest that functions should operate on values only. \r\n\r\nOf course, an implementation could support `key(@)`, but I think it would be as a special case, using internal details unavailable to say, a user taking advantage of an extension function interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

And user-defined functions can cause interoperability problems. We should think twice before opening this door.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, introducing \"current index\" symbol binds the operation to current context. With functions we can build queries like `$.a.b[?(key(@.c.d)==\"e\")]`, but such query can be easily replaced by `$.a.b[?(@.c[\"e\"].d)]` - so we probably don't need to detect index in arbitrary context.\r\n",

          "body": "This issue has expanded into more than what was intended.  So let me clarify my intents:\r\n\r\n- By `@.foo` in expressions, I mean to include any path as used in the context of an expression, be it `@.foo`, `@.foo.bar`, `@[0]`, `$.foo`, or any other path.  I'm not asking whether these are valid in the context of an expression.  I would expect from previous conversations and what's in the spec currently that we agree that they are.\r\n- We've also previously discussed that such paths within expressions must return a single value.  This is not up for discussion here.\r\n- I only intend to discuss the usage of a path in an expression when it is not part of an equality or other comparison.  Specifically, when the only operators, if any, that operate on the path are boolean operators (i.e. `!`, `&&`, and `||`).\r\n- The result set is defined in the current incarnation of the spec to be a nodelist.  This was added out of a need to define it separately from any other JSON array, and it really only applies when discussing the theory behind the spec.  Implementations can design their internal mechanisms however they want so long as the output is what is prescribed by the specification.  This is not up for discussion.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, let's continue the discussion at hand, please.\r\n\r\nI'm asking about considering the results of such expressions as \"truthy.\"  It was my opinion (upon opening the issue) that by considering the result set to be truthy, we restrict our ability to check for strict existence.\r\n\r\nMulling this over for a bit now, I see three options.\r\n\r\n1. Consider paths in expressions as truthy.  This means that we need to define a way to query for strict existence.  We could introduce a function such as `exists(@.foo)` to handle this, but function syntax has been deferred a few times because we haven't defined a sufficient foundation to discuss them.  This seems to also be in line with many existing implementations, though no clear consensus exists.\r\n2. Consider paths in expressions as a strict check for existence.  This means that truthy queries be more complex to include the full intent of truthiness.  This raises questions around what that looks like.  Do we consider `@.foo == true` to be sufficient to express truthiness?  We already decided that `==` and kin don't perform type conversions, so that seems to be off the table.  But that means a user would have to list out all of the \"truthiness\" possibilities.  This gets very messy very quickly, which leads us to the last option.\r\n3. Add a separate operator set for truthy comparisons vs strict comparisons.  This moves us more toward a Javascript operator set instead of the C operator set we've decided on so far.  The nuances of this are less widely known, which means it becomes harder to adopt JSON Path.\r\n\r\nConsidering the implications of these options has led me to believe that the first one is actually most viable.  We just need to define how to specify strict existence.  I rather like the function, but, as I said, we haven't defined them yet.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to all of this, I would be happy to have the specification require the implementation to provide an option to consider such expressions as either truthy or strict existence, and then define what each means.  This would mean a little more work for implementers, but I am one, and I can tell you that I don't mind.  It's our end users that we need to consider most.",

Truthiness rules will produce false when testing a single value. The equality operator will evaluate to true when comparing with the JSON value `null`.  \r\n- Return a special non JSON value, in JavaScript this is `undefined` Truthiness rules will produce false when testing a single value. The (strict) equality operator will evaluate to false when comparing with any JSON value. The equality operator will evaluate to true when comparing with the special value itself, e.g. `undefined` in JavaScript. \r\n- Treat a missing property in an object as a runtime type error. Then the question is how the implementation handles the type error. It can get complicated.    \r\n\r\nJayway JsonPath is an example of the third approach, and it handles this type error differently depending on where in the path it occurs. Evaluating `$.bar`, with missing 'bar', it will throw a `PathNotFound` exception with the message \"Missing property in path\". Evaluating `$[?(@.bar || @.foo )]` with missing `bar` and present `foo`, it will branch to some code that ignores the `@.bar` part so that the other parts of the path evaluation can still be examined.  \r\n\r\n",

Different languages have adopted different rules. Different JSONPath implementations have adopted different rules, or have inherited them from dynamic languages that they use for evaluating expressions. You can of course have a view about what those rules ought to be. \r\n\r\nIf I understand your main point, you want `@.name` to mean something different than \"evaluate the expression \"@.name\" and then check whether the resulting value may be considered true or false\", as it does generally in dynamic languages such as Javascript. You want it to mean \"does `@` contain `name`\".\r\n\r\nI was interested in the case of document\r\n```\r\n[{\"name\": false}]\r\n```\r\nwith query\r\n```\r\n$[?(@.name)]\r\n```\r\nYour implementation returns\r\n```\r\n{\"name\":false}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI compared with a couple of implementations. Goessner Javascript returns no results, as I'd expect. But surprisingly (to me), Jayway returns the same result as yours. After seeing that, I had to go back and edit and tone down some of my original comments about your main point :-) \r\n\r\nI couldn't find a Christoph Burgmer's comparision that specifically covers this case. But [this one](https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/results/filter_expression_without_value.html)  covers the `$[?(!@.name)]` case. This case suggest that six out of 42 implementations (including Jayway) behave the same as your's.  The number may be higher for `$[?(@.name)]`, as many implements can't handle the '!'. I don't agree with that result, because I don't think it's interesting to invent ways of evaluating expressions that are different from our dynamic languages and the textbooks. But it seems that some JSONPath implementations have taken this approach, and it warrants further investigation.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nDaniel\r\n\r\n",

This means a user would be forced to write `@.name == false` to match your case.\r\n\r\nI guess this is an option we can throw into the mix.  Suppose that we make `@.foo` attempt to return a value such that if the value is missing, it results in an internal \"undefined.\"  Given that concept, we have these three options:\r\n\r\n1. **`@.foo` is fully truthy.**  Evaluation of `@.foo` resulting in \"undefined,\" `null`, `false`, `0`, `\"\"`, `{}, or `[]` doesn't match; any other value does match.\r\n2. **`@.foo` is a pure existence test.**  Evaluation of `@.foo` resulting in \"undefined\" doesn't match; any value at all does match.  (what I intended)\r\n3. **`@.foo` operates as a query.**  Evaluation of `@.foo` resulting in \"undefined\" (because of existence) or `false` (because of boolean) doesn't match; any other value does match.  (what mine currently does)\r\n\r\nThe last option has the added benefit that `@.foo` would always operate as a query, whether it was by itself (e.g. `$[?(@.foo)]`) or part of a comparison (e.g. `$[?(@.foo == 2)]`).  In contrast, the first two options would give `@.foo` different meanings depending upon context.\r\n\r\nHonesly, I think any of these options are reasonable, as long as we define which we mean so that implementations can be consistent.  It wouldn't hurt to have a series of tests around this specific behavior, either.",

Cpp (jsoncons) and dotNET (JsonCons.JsonPath)\r\nevaluate absent to be `null`, and `null` is equal to `null`. The JavaScript implementations evaluate absent to be `undefined`,\r\nand `undefined`  is equal to `undefined`. Three of the JavaScript implementations also show `null` equal to `absent` and `absent` equal to `null`, no doubt because of conversion when comparing `undefined` and `null`.\r\n\r\nImplementation              |{}         |{\"key1\" : null}|{\"key2\" : null}|{\"key1\" : false}|{\"key2\" : false}|\r\n----------------------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|\r\nClojure (json-path)         |<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|&nbsp;|<em>&#x2713;</em>|\r\nCpp (jsoncons)              |<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|\r\ndotNET (JsonCons.JsonPath)  |<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|\r\ndotNET (JsonPathLib)        |<em>&#x2713;</em>|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|\r\ndotNET (Manatee.Json)       |<em>&#x2713;</em>|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|\r\nElixir (warpath)            |<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|\r\nErlang (ejsonpath)          |<em>&#x2713;</em>|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|\r\nJavaScript (brunerd)        |<em>&#x2713;</em>|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|\r\nJavaScript (Goessner)       |<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|\r\nJavaScript (jsonpath)       |<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|\r\nJavaScript (jsonpath-plus)  |<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|\r\nRuby (jsonpath)             |<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|\r\nPHP (galbar-jsonpath)       |&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|<em>&#x2713;</em>|<em>&#x2713;</em>|\r\n\r\nWe can deduce that the remaining 30 of 42 implementations do _not_ consider absent equal to absent. Again, the reasons vary. \r\n\r\n15 implementations either fail or return an empty collection. While there is more going on in this test than \"absent equal to absent\", the number 15 lines up with the number in https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/119#issuecomment-919628694 that fail when attempting to evaluate an absent member. So for these, it looks like absent is always an unrecoverable error.\r\n\r\nWhen Jayway evaluates `$[?(@.key1==@.key2)]` with absent `key1` and absent `key2`, it considers the first absence a recoverable error, and it will branch to some code that ignores this comparison, so this comparison selects nothing. That applies to all comparators,  `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`.\r\n\r\n",

These JSONPath implementations group largely into two categories,\r\n\r\n- Implementations that use Javascript/Python/Lua to evaluate filter expressions, where the symbol `@` in the script is substituted with the current node value, and `@.expr` is evaluated as a Javascript/Python/Lua expression, which evaluates to a single value (no result list.)\r\n- Implementations that evaluate `@.<expr>` as a JSONPath expression, but using rules so that the result is produced as a single value rather than a result list. Jayway JSONPath is an example, when evaluating `@.<expr>` in a filter, the slice, union and filter selectors will always produce results wrapped in an array, the wildcard selector will produce results wrapped in an array if there are more than two items, the identifier and index selectors will produce a single value if matched, otherwise a null.  It is done that way in the filter even if the final result returned to the user is a result list (Jayway supports both single value and result list returned to the user.)\r\n\r\nBetween the Javascript/Python implementations and Java Jayway , that accounts for most of the JSONPath implementations in use. Do you know of any prior experience where the LHS and RHS in filter expressions evaluate to result lists (node lists)?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDaniel\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "I have added, what I will call, JsonInclude support to the the json-everything library.  At Greg's suggestion, I am opening this issue to see if there is interest in the community to create a formal spec for this functionality (which I will explain below).  I am also happy to share the code with anyone who is interested.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental goal for JsonInclude is to allow one json document to point to others such that a JsonPath expression can seamlessly jump between documents.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider a server hosting a number of Json documents.  For illustration, imagine the server running at http://example.com, and exposing documents by integer key, such as http://example.com/10, which will return the Json document with key 10.\r\n\r\nNow, consider a document, http://example.com/10 with the contents:\r\n{ \"a\": { \"b\": \"@@http://example.com/11\" } }\r\nAnd, a second document, http://example.com/11 with the contents:\r\n{ \"c\": { \"d\": \"Hello\" } }\r\n\r\nGiven the following code:\r\n\r\nusing var instance = await JsonDocument.ParseAsync(await httpClient.GetStreamAsync(\r\n\t\t\t\t\"http://example.com/10\"));\r\nvar path = JsonPath.Parse(\"$.a.b.c.d\");\r\nvar results = path.Evaluate(instance.RootElement);\r\n\r\nThe results variable will contain the PathMatch for \"Hello\".\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, the simplest example.  At present, my implementation supports the following functionality.\r\n1. Caching.  Once a remote document is loaded, it will not be loaded again.\r\n2. Arbitrary user-defined resolvers.  At present, there are implementations for the following resolvers:\r\n   a. @@http pointing to root\r\n   b. @@http pointing to fragment using JsonPointer\r\n   c. @@http pointing to array of fragments using JsonPath\r\n   d. $ref= pointing to root\r\n   e. $ref= pointing to fragment using JsonPointer\r\n   f.  $ref= pointing to array of fragments using JsonPath\r\n   g. Additional resolvers can be added at will\r\n   h. Arbitrary user-defined retrievers to actually go and get the remote document. Presently, I have only implemented an http/s \r\n       retriever, but one could easily envision a retriever that gets the document from a database.\r\n\r\nAs an example of a different resolver, consider the JsonSchema style { \"$ref\": \"http://example.com/11\" }.  If we wanted to use this style resolver, our two example documents would appear as:\r\n\r\n/10:   { \"a\": { \"b\": {\"$ref\": \"@@http://example.com/11\" } } }\r\n\r\n/11:   { \"c\": { \"d\": \"Hello\" } }\r\n\r\nIn general, the code allows the user to easily define and register new resolvers with five or ten lines of code.  Registration of a new resolver looks like this:\r\n\r\nJsonPathInclude.Resolvers.Add((match) => (match.Value.ValueKind == JsonValueKind.String && match.Value.GetString().StartsWith(\"@@http://\")),\t(match, idx) => JsonPathInclude.StringRootResolver(match, idx));\r\n\r\nThe above code will resolve pointers to remote documents that are specified as string properties prefixed with @@.  Alternatively, or simultaneously, since one can register as many resolvers as desired, we can register a resolver for the $ref case.\r\n\r\nJsonPathInclude.Resolvers.Add((match) => match.Value.ValueKind == JsonValueKind.Object && match.Value.HasProperty(\"ref$\"),\r\n\t\t\t\t(match, idx) => JsonPathInclude.RefRootResolver(match, idx));\r\n\r\nIn addition to pointing to a remote document at its root, the code also supports using JsonPointer and JsonPath.  \r\n\r\nFor example, @@http://localhost:8002/11#/c points to the document /11, but chooses to include only the contents pointed to by the JsonPointer(\"/c\").\r\n\r\nLikewise, @@http://localhost:8002/11#$.c.d3[*], points to /11, but uses the JsonPath(\"$.c.d3[*]\") to find every matching node in /11 (not shown in the shortened example document above) and include those nodes as an array under the node in /10 containing this reference.  In this way, a document can reference any JsonPath addressable subset of nodes in any other document.  And, as always, a JsonPath expression will seamlessly jump across to that subset of nodes in the referenced document.\r\n\r\nIn summary, JsonInclude supports\r\n1. Seamless references between Json documents beneath technologies like JsonPath, thereby allowing JsonPath expressions to extend across a graph/network of related documents.  All features of JsonPath are supported - the JsonInclude library works below the level of JsonPath.\r\n2. Arbitrary user defined resolvers can be added so the format of the references can be anything the user chooses.  For example, I have shown all references as URLs, however, they could easily be nothing more than a UUID, which the resolver could convert to a URL or to any other string that the retriever can use to access the remote document.\r\n3. Arbitrary user defined retrievers\r\n4. Ability to point not only to a remote document root, but also to a specific node using JsonPointer, or to a specific subset of nodes using JsonPath.\r\n\r\nIf my explanation is unclear in any way, please let me know.  I hope others might find this feature to be useful and, if so, it would certainly be great to ultimately see it become a standard and find it's way into the json-everything library.  Regardless, if anyone would like the code, I would be happy to oblige.\r\n\r\nKind Regards.\r\n",

          "body": "Thanks for posting this @greenbergjosh!  I'd like to take this from a perspective of the feature as is pertains to JSON Path in general, excluding anything specific within my implementation.\r\n\r\nI really like this idea, and @greenbergjosh did some great work modifying my library to implement it.  I requested that he post this here as an example of a potential extension that has more to do with processing JSON data than it does the JSON Path syntax.\r\n\r\nFor this to work, no changes need to be made to the JSON Path syntax itself.  The magic is in node selection.\r\n\r\n### A minor correction\r\n\r\nThe `@@http` syntax was the initial proposal.  It was merely a string that could be replaced with the contents of the document to which the URI pointed.  It would be embedded in a JSON value like so:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"foo\": \"@@http://example.com/data\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe selector would see the `@@` followed by a URI and recognize it as a reference to additional data.  It would locate said data and replace the `@@` string with the data and continue selection.\r\n\r\nI had proposed the \"object with a `$ref`\" syntax as an alternative based on how JSON Schema manages references.  I had intended for that to be a replacement to the `@@` key, but I don't think I was clear.  My opinion is that this feature should follow in step with JSON Schema and just have `{ \"$ref\": \"http://...\" }` be the indicator to fetch the specified data and continue selection.  The above example would then be modified to:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"foo\": { \"$ref\": \"http://example.com/data\" }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a bit more verbose, but because of that, it's also more explicit.\r\n\r\nOne interesting aspect of this solution is that the selector can be a bit smarter as well.  If the path contains `$ref`, then the selector just takes the value without dereferencing. so `$.foo['$ref']` would actually yield the URI `http://example.com/data`.\r\n\r\n(The really cool thing about doing this is interoperability with JSON Schema.  You could select nodes from a JSON Schema while dereferencing its built in references!)\r\n\r\n### Further notes on resolution\r\n\r\nIn supporting this reference mechanic, the JSON Schema spec contains language that specifically states that implementations are not required to fetch the data.  The values of `$ref` are actually URIs, not URLs.  The idea is that the implementation is not required to make network calls or look on the file system; it can instead have additional documents preloaded with URIs.  I think this is an important aspect that should be copied/borrowed.",

          "body": "It is likely worth mentioning the idea of cycle detection. I have not yet added this to my implementation, but it might be worth considering. I don\u2019t think all cycles are necessarily bad. Consider, parent.child[0].parents[*].name, which we might consider as returning the names of both parents of a child, having started from one parent. To avoid confusion, I am speaking of human parents and children in this example. Clearly, there is a cycle, but the result is still useful. For this reason, it might make sense to specify a max revisit count. As I see Greg focused here more on specification than implementation, I will comment that this may be an implementation detail.\r\n\r\nIt might make sense to consider a distinction between implicit and explicit cycles. For example, if I do $.a..f I may hit an include cycle and I have not explicitly requested it, so it would be implicit. On the other hand, if I do $.a.b.a.c, I have explicitly requested it, and it is clearly finite. So, perhaps one could allow explicit cycles but disallow implicit cycles that exceed some specified length. ",

This was primarily used in the `[(<expr>)]` syntax such as `[(@.length-1)]` as a way to denote the last element in an array.  For now, we have elected to exclude this syntax.\r\n\r\nThe `.length` syntax can also be used in the `[?(<expr>)]` syntax such as `[?(@.length<10)]` to find array elements which are objects or arrays which themselves have fewer than 10 keys/items.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is an ambiguity between `length` as a property of an array and `length` as an object key.  **We need to address this ambiguity.**\r\n\r\nAs of opening this issue, the syntax is disallowed, implying it can only have the \"object key\" semantics.  But since the vast majority of implementation support this ([object](https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/results/dot_notation_with_key_named_length.html) / [array](https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/results/dot_notation_with_key_named_length_on_array.html)), it can be inferred that path authors use this feature.  Therefore, we need to support this feature in some way.\r\n\r\nDue to the ambiguity stated above, I think we need an alternate syntax.  To start, I would like to propose the function syntax `length(@)` which would return the number of items in an object/array or 0 for non-structured values.\r\n\r\nIt is recognized that we don't yet have a function syntax defined, so maybe that needs to be addressed first.  I'm also open to other proposals that wouldn't require that we define a new class of syntax.",

It's stated (and guaranteed) that it's a subset of standard path syntax, but no further details on the relationship are presented.

When an implementation produces normalized paths, it simply produces them from indices and names as they process a query against a JSON document, there's no converting `single quoted` into `normal quoted`.

If I'm building an application like the Amazon example, where I need to validate that an input path will return at most one node, I am not going to go to the spec, build a parser, and build in the logic myself to determine that. I'm going to look for an implementation. To be spec-compliant, an implementation has to provide me with a `query` operation that takes a document and returns a nodelist, in whatever form it chooses.

It does *not* have to support normalized paths.

      "body": "Please excuse me if this has been fully covered; I've been reading over the history of #109, [the minutes where it was discussed](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-112-jsonpath/), and messages in the [mailing list](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/jsonpath/MT_WROl1XpUWYOGy69HMAR2DVVI/) and I'm not sure this specific question has been asked.\r\n\r\nThere has been discussion of how object keys might be referenced in a filter selector (e.g., with an `index()` function), which it seems like has been settled as out of scope. A different question, to my mind, is \"Can a JSON Path address an object key?\"\u2014has this been asked? Is an object key a node? The spec says:\r\n\r\n> For the purposes of this specification, a value as defined by RFC8259 is also viewed as a tree of nodes.  Each node, in turn, holds a value.  Further nodes within each value are the elements of arrays and the member values of objects and are themselves values. (The type of the value held by a node may also be referred to as the type of the node.)\r\n\r\nThis does seem to scope nodes only to values. The closest thing I could find to someone asking my question is [this message](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/jsonpath/iIej1cnzEoHkjKgBO41ZXOXhUWI/) which mentions key-value pairs, and has no further discussion. It seems a little strange to me that as general-purpose as JSON Path is, it does not provide for addressing all elements of a JSON document.\r\n\r\nOne possible answer to this is, \"an implementation may make the object key available as a property of a node in the nodelist it returns for a path\". This would suffice for a user processing a JSON document and needing to extract this information, but that's separate from being able to reference that key as a first-class element within the document, for example when an interface accepts a JSON pointer as input for some action it will take on the pointed-to element.\r\n\r\nAnother possible answer, to my mind, would be something like an \"index name selector\". For the sake of argument, say this took the form of `#index` (setting aside choice of separator, etc), and the path definition was something like \r\n```abnf\r\njson-path = root-selector *(S primary-selector) [ S primary-selector S \"#index\" ] ; the root can't have an index name\r\n                                                                                  ; no further selectors can be applied after it\r\nprimary-selector = (dot-selector        /\r\n                    dot-wild-selector   /\r\n                    index-selector      /\r\n                    index-wild-selector /\r\n                    list-selector       /\r\n                    slice-selector      /\r\n                    descendant-selector /\r\n                    filter-selector)\r\n```\r\nThe index name selector would be defined to produce a string node whose value is the object key or array index when applied to a node in an object or array, or no node otherwise. With something like this, it would allow a user to definitively reference object keys (and array indexes) with a JSON Path. And it would additionally allow object keys to be referenced in filter selectors without a separate syntax, which would address a number of the concerns I saw surrounding that.\r\n\r\nAs I said, this may have been thought about and decided upon already, but as I couldn't find it after some digging, I thought I would pose the question for consideration.",

The filter should go through this list of comparisons:\r\n\r\n```\r\npath(@) = $\r\nSo @.foo === $.foo\r\nFilter is TRUE if:\r\nany([\r\n  $.foo == $.baz,\r\n  $.foo == $.baz.bar,          // true\r\n  $.foo == $.baz.bar.biz,\r\n  $.foo == $.baz.biz,\r\n  $.foo == $.baz.biz[0],\r\n  $.foo == $.baz.biz[1],\r\n  $.foo == $.baz.biz[2],\r\n  $.foo == $.baz.biz[2].foo, // true\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat was my thought.

The main question here is not just \"how to use `rel-path` in request\", but much wide: specification of the internal script language.\r\n\r\nWe are already able to use requests like `$[!(@.length - 1)]` to get the last element from the list, but what is the `@.length - 1` for sure? It is the modification of the given variables. So it could be `@.foo - 1` as an example. We already \"know\", what is the `@.foo` here, we have at least part of the specification here, but the second question: what is `1` in this request? And it is just literal. So we met the third and main question here: what types of data and literal particularly do we have? Data types are: `null`, `numeric`, `bool`, `string`, `array` and `object`. It's logical to assume, that literals will have the same list of types. \r\n\r\nAnd now we face the problem: we know how to create and modify \"simple\" types, like `string` or `numeric`, but what about complex? Should we be able to compare arrays? Like this: `?(@.array == [1, 2, 3])`. Probably yes. That means that we should be able to create literal with the array type. \r\n\r\nShould we be able to create a variable `numeric` type? Sure! Request `@.length - 1` is the variable `numeric` value. \r\n\r\nAnd what about variable `array` or `object` type? What about request: `?(@.array == [@.foo, @.bar, @.baz])`?\r\n\r\nMost of those questions are not about `JSONPath` itself, but `script` mostly.  And yes, I suppose in the initial release it can be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n@danielaparker, Ok, I see... Currently, I should deeper investigate the specification and understand why is `@` is not the JSONPath expression. From my point of view, it should be the same, so I have to learn about it more.\r\n\r\nRegarding this: \r\n> As for existing implementations, I don't think there are any that allow path expressions inside JSON literals, none that allow {\"foo\": $..bar} as an operand.\r\n\r\nYes. And that is the biggest problem for me.\r\n\r\nCreating `ajson` library, I thought about the possibility to get atomic values from the whole payload and modify only them. But today I'd like to wide this possibility to be able to **create** values through request. To be able to use a scripting language from the JSONPath to create new payloads, like this:\r\n```go\r\najson.JSONPath(`!({\r\n  \"foo\": $..foo,\r\n  \"bar\": {$..bar: $..baz}\r\n})`, data)\r\n```\r\nSo, if script request `!()` could be used outside of the `filter-request` it can push JSONPath to a new level.\r\n\r\n**But! That is only my point of interest, so I will not push spec to follow this way.**",

In JMESPath, the query\r\n```\r\n{\"foo\": baz.biz[2].foo, \"bar\": foo}\r\n```\r\napplied to the document\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"foo\": \"bar\",\r\n  \"baz\": {\r\n    \"bar\": {\"biz\": \"bar\"},\r\n    \"biz\": [null, \"foo\", {\"foo\": \"bar\"}]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\ngives the result\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"foo\": \"bar\",\r\n  \"bar\": \"bar\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also do it in [JSONiq](https://www.jsoniq.org/), an ISO/IEC approved, OASIS standard. JSONiq was largely incorporated into XQuery 3.1, in a way that integrates the XML and JSON data models. The big vendors have mostly moved to XQuery for querying and transforming data, whether XML or JSON, IBM WebSphere still uses an older version of JSONiq.

The former generally restrict JSONPath to selecting elements in the original document only, the latter permit results that are computations performed on the original document.\r\n\r\n(1) Implementations that use JavaScript (or Python or PHP) for evaluating JSONPath filter expressions, including original JavaScript Goessner, have access to all the JavaScript (or Python or PHP) functions. For example, they have access to functions that return the Unicode Normalization Form of strings, see [JavaScript String.prototype.normalize](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize) (or [Python unicodedata.normalize](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize) or [PHP normalizer.normalize](https://www.php.net/manual/en/normalizer.normalize.php)).\r\n\r\n(2) The important and influential [Jayway implementation](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) introduced functions that can be invoked at the tail end of the path, as you mentioned. These can be used to return results that are computations performed on the original document.\r\n\r\n(3) A couple of implementations that made up their own filter expression languages support function syntax like\r\n```\r\n$.books[?(tokenize(@.author,'\\\\s+')[-1] == 'Tolkien')]\r\n```\r\nsee e.g. [here](https://danielaparker.github.io/JsonCons.Net/articles/JsonPath/JsonConsJsonPath.html#functions).\r\n",

This should make them easily identifiable in expressions.\r\n- A function MUST have parentheses, even if there are no parameters.\r\n- The parameter list MUST be comma-delimited.  Each parameter may be any valid JSON Path expression, including the constant values that are allowed, e.g. booleans, numbers, etc, but not structured values (unless those are supported by the time functions are implemented).\r\n- A function MUST return a value.\r\n\r\nI would also suggest that parameters have an _expected_ type.

They can definitely evaluate to arrays and objects.

Parameterless functions exist.  I considered using `index(@)`, but then it only makes sense for the parameter to be `@`, so why have it at all?  Not having a parameter means that someone couldn't do `index(@.foo)`, which is a pointless function because it just returns `\"foo\"`.  Making this a parameterless function makes it hard for users to do things they're not allowed to do or don't make sense.  It already knows that its context is the current item (and the item's parent).  (Presumably, the implementation is iterating through the items in a loop and has access to these things, at which point it can pass that context to whatever implementation it has internally.)\r\n",

In a JSONPath expression, a bare `@` evaluates to a value, a value that does not carry with it any information about the array index or object member name from whence it came. It is only a value. \r\n\r\nOf course, an implementation could use the _notation_ `index(@)` to represent the index or name associated with `@`, but it would be an ad hoc thing, using information unavailable to your custom function, were it to be passed `@`.  \r\n\r\n> Making this a parameterless function makes it hard for users to do things they're not allowed to do or don't make sense. It already knows that its context is the current item (and the item's parent).\r\n\r\nIn order for the function to \"know\" anything about its context, it needs to be passed a parameter (possibly hidden) such as \"this\" in C++ or \"self\" in Python, or otherwise be bound to an environment. To support that would make a specification for functions much more complicated, certainly beyond that of [JMESPath functions](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#built-in-functions), for example. \r\n\r\n",

But we're trying to build a query syntax, and that affords us some liberties.\n\nI think you're looking at it from a pure-functional point of view.  A pure function would, in most cases, return a constant without any parameters.  But as I said, we're not building a _programming_ language, functional or otherwise.\n\nAn example of a parameterless function (in another query language) would be SQL's `DATE()` function, which returns the current date.  It is _defined_ to have the context of the system on which the query is running.  It _never_ returns the same value twice (without adjusting the system or mocking that dependency entirely).\n\nSimilarly, the `index()` function could be _defined_ to have the context of the iterator in which it runs, i.e. the filter query `[?()]`.\n\nSince you made a parallel with C++, consider this like a member function that's defined on the iterator itself rather than a static/global function.  Even if you consider `this` as a (hidden) parameter, it doesn't appear as a parameter when you call it (\"hidden\" \ud83d\ude09);  the parameter list is empty.\n\n`length(x)` acts more like the pure function you're thinking of.  It doesn't need any context; it just acts on the parameter it's given.  But this doesn't mean that `index()` must also work that way.\n\nLastly, defining `index()` this way opens the door for others functions, and even user-defined functions if we do that, to do similar things, which I think it's extremely useful.  Requiring only pure functions severely inhibits their usefulness.",

But there is plenty outside of JSONPath for omitting _both_ the \"current node\" symbol and the dot - see [The \"current value\" or \"current node\", and the meaning thereof](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/76). That's the case for JMESPath and XPath. SQL also permits omitting qualifying table names or aliases when there is no ambiguity.\r\n\r\nAllowing `foo` in place of `@.foo` does mean that unquoted names should not be allowed to start with a digit, otherwise expressions like `$foo[?(2 == 4)]` would be ambiguous. There is some data about that [here](https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/results/filter_expression_with_dot_notation_with_number.html), a minority of JSONPath implementations do allow unquoted names that start with a digit, as did earlier versions of the draft. But it looks like recent versions of the draft do not, so could accommodate your proposal.\r\n\r\n> Why is `$.foo` allowed at the root but not `@.foo`?\r\n\r\nThat's a good question. There was a [proposal by Davide Bettio](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/59) to support `@.foo` at the root, and it was discussed at the [May 2021 ietf meeting](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-interim-2021-jsonpath-01-202105110900/). The proposal was dismissed with the \"consensus\" that \"Queries should not begin with @, but this is a natural extension point.\"\r\n\r\nIt's not obvious from reading the minutes that the committee fully understood that not accomodating JSONPath expressions beginning with `@` was tantamount to asserting that expressions in filters beginning with `@` were not JSONPath expressions (unfortunately Bettio was not present to defend the proposal.) In any case, it's clear in the draft that they are not, the draft defines them as\r\n```\r\nrel-path     = \"@\" *(S (dot-selector / index-selector))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn terms of prior experience, implementations (at least the important ones) group into two categories.\r\n\r\n(1) Implementations including original JavaScript Goessner that use JavaScript (or Python or PHP) for evaluating JSONPath filter expressions. In these scripts, `@` is substituted with the \"current value\", and expressions consisting of the \"current value\" followed by a dot or a left square bracket are evaluated according to JavaScript (or Python or PHP) rules. This always result in a single value. \r\n\r\n(2) JSONPath implementations that make up their own expression languages.  The important ones (Java Jayway, JSON.Net), regard expressions starting with `@` as JSONPath expressions in their own right, and evaluate them as such. They specify rules for evaluating them as a single value (rather than a list of values) so that evaluations and JSON literals can be meaningfully compared.\r\n\r\nThe draft authors chose to follow the second group by inventing their own expression language, but the first group by making expressions beginning with `@` somewhat analogous to evaluating JavaScript variables with index and identifier operators. It's unclear to me why they made that choice. I think it would be helpful if they included some notes in the draft to motivate their decisions in terms of prior experience.\r\n",

Examples of usage would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@ is boolean\r\n@ is string\r\n@ is number\r\n@.foo is object\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo support this, we would need to reserve `object`, `array`, `boolean`, `number`, `null`, and `string` as reserved keywords in expressions, meaning that functions could not bear these names.  I don't think that this would cause any problems.\r\n\r\nIt could also support value coercion on the RHS.  For example `@ is $.foo`, could return `true` if `$.foo` is a string containing one of these type keywords.\r\n\r\n## A sub-par alternative\r\n\r\nI had also considered a `type(x)` function to build on [my proposal for functions](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/issues/160#issuecomment-1069549608).\r\n\r\nThe `type(x)` function would take a single parameter and return... well that's the problem.  What would it return?  It can't rightly return a string.  It would have to return some implementation-internal concept of a \"value type\", and then we'd have to add support for equality.\r\n\r\n`type(@) == object` and `type(@) == \"object\"` just don't feel right.\r\n\r\nI think the `is` operator is the way to go for this feature.",

      "body": "Considering that, according to the grammar, `exist-expr` is a `boolean-exrp`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexist-expr        = [neg-op S] singular-path \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the following note:\r\n> A member or element value by itself in a Boolean context is interpreted as false only if it does not exist. Otherwise it is interpreted as true. To be more specific about the actual value, explicit comparisons are necessary. This existence test -- as an exception to the general rule -- also works with structured values.\r\n\r\nSo this would mean that a singular path that points to a boolean `false` value would evaluate to `true`.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n   { \"id\": 1, \"isActive\": true },\r\n   { \"id\": 2, \"isActive\": false },\r\n   { \"id\": 3, \"isActive\": true },\r\n]\r\n```\r\nPeople might try:\r\n`$[?(@.isActive)]` to get the active elements but will be surprised to see all elements returned.\r\n\r\nI think this kind of query is quite common and for people with a developer background it would feel unnatural to type `boolean expression == true`\r\n\r\nOn the other side,  the need for queries that check *implicitly* for existence feels rarer to me (from my experience mostly well-typed tagged unions are used to structure JSON), which makes me wonder if `exists` should be a function instead (once functions get added to the spec).\r\n\r\nThis would make the `exists` check more explicit and therefore less confusing, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nPersonally, I would like to:\r\n- have an explicit way of checking existence.\r\n- evaluate singular path to a boolean value (which could be seen as a tautological statement) in the above example\r\n\r\nWhen a singular path is given as a boolean expression but does not point to a boolean value, it gets a bit tricky:\r\n- it could throw an error at the evaluation\r\n- evaluate to false always\r\n- introduce the concept of truthy & falsy values, which could serve similar use cases as `exists`, in this case, `true` would be `truthy` and `false` would be falsy and the above described problem would go away\r\n\r\nI normally am more a statically typed programming language guy so not too keen on the concept of truthy & falsy values, but considering this is a query language for JSON, it might make more sense...\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

          "body": "> JSON is schema-free and thus dynamically typed\r\n\r\nThis is just wrong.  _Javascript_ is dynamically typed because it considers objects with different property sets to be different types.  _JSON_ is statically typed: objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and the constants `true`, `false`, and `null`.  (Practically speaking, `true` and `false` are booleans.  Making this distinction is splitting hairs and not worth our time.)  For JSON, objects with different property sets, while they are not equivalent, are still the same type: `object`.\r\n\r\n> introduce a new primitive value `undefined`...\r\n\r\nWe've had plenty of conversations stating that we don't want to introduce `undefined` as a value.  To reiterate the above, JSON isn't Javascript; there is no `undefined` in JSON.\r\n\r\n> `if x == true {...}` definitely is a code smell\r\n\r\nAgreed, but the point of the argument is that for the expression `!x`, `x` _appears_ to represent some boolean-ish value, and then the `!` operator is negating that result.\r\n\r\nWe also have declared that expressions in filter selectors (`[?(<expr>)]`) must return boolean values.\r\n\r\nThis results in a syntactical ambiguity for `[?(!@.foo)]`:\r\n\r\n- Is the user testing for the existence of a property?\r\n- Is the user testing for the \"truthiness\" of the value at that property?\r\n\r\nThe _only_ way to know for sure is by forcing `!` followed by a local path (e.g. `!@.foo`) to mean an existence test, which means the _only_ way to check for \"truthiness\" is to compare with a `true` or `false` constant.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, my implementation, https://json-everything.net/json-path, returns all three items for the example above, acting as a true existence test.  This means that for my library, you MUST use `x == true` to only get the \"truthy\" ones.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I see two options to resolve this ambiguity:\r\n\r\n1. An expression in the form `!@.foo` is defined explicitly as an existence test, which forces path authors to use expressions like `x == true` for \"truthiness\" checks (would return three items from the above example).\r\n2. Expressions strictly return booleans except in the special case of `!@.foo`, for which the expression is \"truthy\" or \"falsy.\"  This forces some other form of existence test, e.g. a function form like `exists(@.foo)` (would return two items from the above example).\r\n\r\n***NOTE** We've also discussed truthiness at length, and if I recall, we decided against it.  I use it here solely to illustrate my point.*",

Query is able to match arbitrary amount of nodes. It's an attribute of a query, too, and it's enough to have a single \"multi-matching\" matcher (like `*`) in chain to tag all the query as \"multi-matching\".\r\n\r\nBut on some JSON data multi-matching query will match exactly one node, which makes it possible to behave like single-matching query 1; I mean, node list with a single node can be reduced to a single node.\r\n\r\nQuery attributes can be used for analysis by client software to ensure that given query is garanteed to match either exactly one either none of nodes.

The \"outermost\" list always represents the fact the implementation is returning a list of nodes.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the non-preferred \"scalar\" approach of always returning a scalar or error. If a single node matched which contains a scalar value, that value is returned. Again, I don't think there is any ambiguity.\r\n",

Just try execute `$.store` [here](https://jsonpath.herokuapp.com/) on Goessner's example - and you'll get a single JSON object. Execute `$.store.book` - and get a single array (exactly what I've meant by \"ambiguous\").

But on the other hand, we have no \"bracket child\" anymore: brackets define union now (and the former \"bracket child\" is just a special case of singular union) - that's the main reason for having them, I believe.\r\n\r\nI feel that if both interpretations are surprising, then we should probably forbid the quotes in dot-child-name at all, bringing some existing queries as a sacrifice to clarity.

Which is good because the JSON in JSONPath has a historical connection with JS. Should we mention that the core slicing syntax (excluding the step part) is based on JavaScript semantics?\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(array) may not be exhaustive but shows that python is the only language that has inclusive start, exclusive end and a step.\r\n\r\nThe \"python connection\" thus comes into play only once we introduce `step`. If we want to support `step` (not sure if we have to), then I think it would be quite confusing if the behaviour of JSONPath were different than the only other (popular) language that has the `first:end:step` syntax.\r\n\r\nWhether the spec should explicitly acknowledge this connection is another question. One one hand it would be weird to not acknowledge it, but on the other hand, what if the spec ends up being subtly different from python's? is there an unambiguous spec of the slicing expression for python or is it de-facto implementation defined?",

Implementers want a parsimonious vocabulary with precise meaning, preferably one that's consistent with the core specifications (RFC 8259), the introduction of synonyms which are \"suggestive\" only frightens them. What's suggestive to one is misleading to another, for example, \"field\" in the Java specifications refers to a type and an identifier, in a CODASYL data record it means something else. \"property\" isn't mentioned in RFC 8259, why introduce it here?      \r\n\r\nRegarding \"perhaps we should define 'key'\", if it appears in the ABNF, it _is_ defined. Although again, my own preference would be to stick to the RFC 8259 term \"name\". Agreed, it's not \"better\", but so what? Clarity and consistency with the core specifications should in my opinion be the main concern.",

If we can find a solution which avoids a copy and which still offers a rendered version, that would be great. (I tried checking in a symlink, but that didn't end happily!)",

              "body": "Just to note, I share with @gregsdennis some discomfort with the \"nodelist\" concept, and am skeptical that it's needed to describe JSONPath. I don't think the idea of a \"nodelist\" is required to describe the distinguishing feature of JSONPath, that it returns a collection of values (or references) to items that already exist in the original JSON document. We have from the [very beginning](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) the notion that \"the return value of jsonPath is an array, which is also a valid JSON structure. So you might want to apply jsonPath to the resulting structure\". Practically all implementations support something like:\r\n```\r\nJSON = jsonPath(JSON, path, value option)    \r\n```\r\nor \r\n```\r\nJSON = jsonPath(JSON, path, path option)\r\n```\r\nWith duplicates allowed, which is the case for legacy implementations, the computational model is simply to collect values (or their associated paths). Where is the role for \"nodelists\"?\r\n\r\nWith no duplicates, which is the case for some modern implementations, the computational model is to compute both values and their associated (normalized) paths, and to keep path-value pairs with unique paths. Again, where is the role for \"nodelists\"?\r\n\r\nIn XPath, with it's vastly more complicated data model, I understand the need for \"nodelist\". But I don't understand why we need to take this XPath idea and transpose it to JSONPath. It seems to me to be an unnecessary concept for describing JSONPath.\r\n\r\nI would also suggest that the draft  isn't clear about what it means by \"node\". In a discussion in the terminology issue, @glyn suggested that if I wasn't familiar with trees and nodes, I could consult Wikipedia. But what's important is not what I understand or don't understand, what's important is what the draft says. In XPath specifications, the meaning of \"node\" is crystal clear, in the draft, it is not. I think that lack of clarity is somewhat related to the problem of making an argument for the \"nodelist\" concept that readers such as myself might find convincing.\r\n\r\nI think there should be an issue raised for \"nodelist, and the justification thereof\".  Perhaps @cabo could start one?\r\n",

FORTRAN only had INTEGER, which was signed.  In the 1970s, languages started to address the issue, but didn't find terminology that they could use from mathematics.  \"Natural\" is both (1..) and (0..) in common usage, so it is ambiguous.  A number of languages used \"Cardinal\" for unsigned integers.  C led the pack with going for \"unsigned\", and that is the term that has stuck.  But, incredibly, as late as the mid 1990s languages were designed that didn't have unsigned types (e.g., Java).\r\n\r\nTo me, requiring the clumsy term \"non-negative\" for unsigned is a bit like requiring to say \"octet\" for byte, except that the latter was actually a reasonable thing until about 1981 (when non-8-bit bytes became extinct).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm not arguing for using \"unsigned\" in this PR, because I want to make progress, but, for the record, that's what it *should* be.",

In the JMESPath wording, there is no \"if it's used outside the filter it means this\" or \"if it's used inside the filter it means that\". There is just one consistent meaning for the \"current-node\", represented by `@`, it means the node currently being evaluated.\r\n\r\nThe original [JSONPath article](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) doesn't say much about the current node, it uses `@` to represent it (referred to as \"current object\"),  and gives two examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$.store.book[(@.length-1)].title                   (1)\r\n\r\n$.store.book[?(@.price < 10)].title               (2)\r\n```\r\nBoth of those examples are fully consistent with the JMESPath wording. In (1), the \"current node\" @ represents the array `$.store.book`, in (2), the `?` connotes iteration over the array, and `@` represents the array element.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to generalize that at `$`, the current node `@` represents '$', at `$.store`, it represents `$.store`, and so on.",

The caller may call it doing something like:\r\n`json_path_eval(root, root.foo, \"@.bar\")` which is equivalent to `json_path_eval(root, root, \"$.foo.bar\")`.\r\nNo higher level function magic here ;)\r\nAnyway let's keep out of the discussion implementation detail, again I just need to make sure that `@.bar` (with the meaning that I just showed in the example) is not left out of the spec.\r\n\r\nLastly the PR just aims to allow `@` at the beginning of the expression, I think more PRs are needed for a complete `@` formalization.  \r\n\r\n@danielaparker thanks for your feedback, looking forward to further comments :)",

Also called a JSON value.\", this seems to be related to @ttimbrays posts [here](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-jsonpath/issues/66#issuecomment-804425507) and [here](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-jsonpath/issues/66#issuecomment-804425507). Perhaps \"Data Item\" could be dropped and just use \"JSON value\", as @ttimbrays proposed?\r\n\r\nRegarding \"Argument: Short name for the JSON data item a JSONPath expression is applied to\", this also seems to be related  to @ttimbrays post [here](https://github.com/ietf-wg-jsonpath/draft-ietf-jsonpath-jsonpath/issues/66#issuecomment-804425507). Perhaps \"Argument\" could be replaced with \"root value\", as @ttimbray suggested?\r\n\r\nNote that if a node is regarded as a value/location pair, than a JSON value cannot be considered as a \"tree of nodes\", or a \"node\" itself. We can define a \"children\" property on a JSON value, which can be considered its members or elements if such exist. But we cannot define a \"location\" property for a JSON value, it's not possible, and \"location\" seems to be an essential property of a node as understood in the processing model defined in this PR. See [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel-31/#Node) for a related definition of \"node\" in the XQuery and XPath Data Model 3.1. JSONPath doesn't need a notion of \"node\" as complicated as XDM, but minimally it needs location, children, and value properties.\r\n\r\nI don't think this observation presents a great difficulty for the PR, but I think that mentions of JSON values as \"trees of nodes\" and remarks that \"the term _node_ has the same meaning [as JSON value]\" would be better expunged.\r\n\r\n",

Replaced with extended verbiage at the beginning of the section that declares that 8259 applies.\r\n- Replaced \"JSON value\" with \"value\" in line with the above.\r\n- Relabeled \"output path\" as \"normalized path\"\r\n\r\n## Additions\r\n\r\n- String - a clarification and expansion on the JSON definition\r\n- Root Node\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\n- Reordered terms and paragraphs so that reading through doesn't use terms that haven't been defined yet (as much as possible).\r\n- Removed a redundant parenthetical sentence in the *Processing Model* section.\r\n- Removed some un-necessary self-references (e.g. \"JSONPath query\" rather than just \"query\").\r\n- Made some general edits\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n### Existing in-place definitions\r\n\r\n\"Selector\" and \"slice\" are defined in-place where they're needed.  Do we need to define them in the terminology section as well?\r\n\r\n### Key\r\n\r\nThe draft currently uses \"name\" instead of \"key\" as we had agreed in the meeting.  I suspect that this is because 8259 uses \"name.\"  Since we're trying to align with that, I've left in \"name.\"\r\n\r\n### Index\r\n\r\nWe discussed using \"index\" as a generic term for either a numeric index for arrays or a name for objects.  However in editing this section, I'm starting to second-guess that decision.\r\n\r\nGiven that we've opted to define a union selector as taking as arguments \"indices,\" \"slices,\" and/or \"filters,\" I don't think it's too much of a stretch to separately include \"indices\" and \"names.\"  Because of this, I left the definition of \"index\" as is.\r\n\r\nThis also addresses the tendency to associate \"index\" with arrays, as @glyn had mentioned.\r\n\r\nI'm leaving the changes to \"union selector\" to include all of the various things it can accept for another PR as this is solely to clean up terminology.\r\n\r\n### Emphasizing terms\r\n\r\nI tried capitalizing defined terms to emphasize their special meaning.  It got weird to read, though, since they're used so frequently.  Maybe not _every_ instance of the terms needs to be emphasized.  I'm not sure.  Happy to discuss.\r\n\r\nI've left this change out for now, but there are definitely inconsistencies present already.\r\n",

When I say \"8259\", mean [this RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259) (also denoted by `{{-json}}` in the raw text) which is what it appears the spec is referencing.

It doesn't make sense to define it in two places.  The common practice (as I've seen) is to refer to existing definitions.  Since we're relying heavily on the definition of JSON anyway, it makes sense to just reference those definitions.  Anyone unfamiliar with JSON should want to read that spec as well.\n\n> Why do you think it is detrimental to remind readers that object does not have the English meaning in this document?\n\nI _do_ keep the callout that we're not using the English meaning of \"object\" and \"array.\" I've just moved it up to the text where I claim the definitions from the JSON spec.",

A JSON text is a serialized value.\r\n2. `JSON-text = ws value ws`\r\n3. A JSON value MUST be an object, array, number, or string, or one of the following three literal names: [...]\r\n4. An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets surrounding zero or more name/value pairs (or members).\r\n\r\nOne way to read statement 1 is that a value is serlalized to produce JSON text and therefore a value is not itself in serial form. But statement 2 seems to imply that a value _is_ in serial form. So I think statement 1 has to be read as \"A JSON text is a value in a serialized form.\"\r\n\r\nIf a value is in a serialized form, then statement 3 implies that an object is also in a serialized form.\r\n\r\nBut statement 4 is then confusing:\r\n* It seems to be defining an object structure rather than an object.\r\n* It's probably trying to define an object and say that an object is a structure (in the normal use of the word).\r\n* It says an object (structure) \"_is represented as_ a pair of curly brackets [...]\", but if an object is a serialized thing, it _is_ a pair of curly brackets etc. (Or, perhaps better, an object _consists of_ a pair of curly brackets etc.)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether we should attempt to clarify this in the JSONPath spec or submit an erratum to 8259 - probably the latter makes more sense.\r\n",

But it is a rather poor document, and the errata process is not designed to fix its problems.\r\n\r\nBut the situation is actually worse.  When writing the JSONpath specification, we have to think about its audience and not about how we ourselves would like this document to be.  Most people who will read the JSONpath specification will come out of one of the JSON sub-ecosystems and will think that they know what JSON is.  They won't read 8259 just because we reference it.  It simply is not helpful to defer to 8259, we have to make sure that the terms we need are introduced properly.  (Not *defined* -- that is indeed what 8259 needs to be the authoritative reference for.). This is more important because the 8259 terminology is peculiar (its accidental or deliberate ambiguities served its purpose well in the painstaking 8259 process, but that doesn't mean it's particularly good for specifications that actually make use of JSON).\r\n\r\nI wish we could focus on creating a good document for its audience, instead of discussing whether something theoretically needs to be brought up or not.\r\n",

When was this discussed? \r\n\r\nI wasn't there.  Must have been before 1972, but I'm pretty sure after 1960.\r\n\r\n> Do we now have to say \"boolean literal\" or \"numeric literal?\" \r\n\r\nIf we mean the literal, yes.  If we mean the value, no.\r\nThe important part is to make the distinction.\r\n\r\n> Where does JSON Path ever use strings that AREN'T a string literal?\r\n\r\nThe strings in the argument are no longer literals at the time we get them.\r\nAlso, as soon as a string literal in the query is parsed, it is the resulting value that is then used; different literals for the same value are not distinguishable for the purposes of the language.\r\n\r\nOf course, all this can be done differently, but that is the way it has been done in language design for approximately half a century.\r\n",

We cannot forbid existence operations within comparative expressions, if we don't want do error handling (which is not syntactically based).\r\n\r\nGeneral drawback: We cannot tell, if  `!@.foo == true` is `true` because of its value `false` or inexistence.

Other approaches define a complete ordering on JSON values, assuming where types differ that `null < boolean < number < object < array < string` (following Python.)  \r\n\r\n",

In that case no selection occurs,\r\nWe can include strings on basis of lexical ordering though.\r\n\r\nRegarding `1 < true` ... we opposed against implicit type conversion, so no selection occurs here.\r\n\r\nBut ... as I was always in favor of comparing primitive values only, I would be happy to return to that clean solution again.

The domain of indices is signed integers. That domain is restricted to non-negative integers for normalized paths, it's not that they've suddenly become unsigned.\r\n\r\nI get this discussion often.  Non-negative is pedantic.  The range of actual array indexes actually is unsigned integer, so why not just say that.

The questions it raises are:\r\n\r\n* What thing is unique?\r\n* What is the set of things among which the thing is unique?\r\n\r\nIn this context, \"uniquely identifies a node\" could be taken a couple of ways:\r\n\r\n1. A Normalized Path is the only JSONPath (with certain characteristics) that identifies a particular node. This is true.\r\n2. A Normalized Path identifies a unique node. This is not true if we are allowed to vary the JSON document.\r\n\r\nAs for \"eineindeutig\", I understand this to refer to the mathematical concept of a one-one correspondence. For a given JSON document, there is indeed a one-one correspondence between its nodes and the Normalized Paths that identify these nodes. But the above proposal doesn't talk about a given JSON document, in which case the one-one correspondence doesn't make much sense.\r\n\r\nI think we need an informal definition of Normalized Path so readers have a chance of engaging. We could follow it up with some more text along the lines of:\r\n\r\n> For a given JSON document,  there is a one to one correspondence between the document's nodes and the Normalized Paths that identify these nodes.",

Making equality silently result in `false` in the non-singular path case is more surprising/obscure for the users than a syntax error on a non-singular path.\r\n2.

It evaluates them as a single value according to the following rules: The slice, recursive descent and union selectors, which can evaluate to zero, one, or many items, are wrapped in a Json array. The object wildcard selector is wrapped in an array if the object has two or more members, otherwise a single value is returned. The array wildcard operator always returns an array. The others - current node, identifier, and index selectors - evaluate to a single value if matched, otherwise a null value.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the important JSONPath implementations that invent their own filter expressions generally allow expressions beginning with `@` to be first class JSONPath expressions. And they evaluate them as single values within filter expressions, they need to produce single values for comparisons with JSON literals to make sense. So they all have rules for that, but they don't all follow the same rules as Jayway. Nonetheless, Jayway is probably the most important and influential of these.\r\n\r\nThe alternative you find in prior experience are the implementations that use JavaScript or Python or PHP for filter expressions. In these, expressions beginning with `@` aren't JSONPath expressions at all. Here `@` is simply a JavaScript or Python or PHP variable, with supported indexing operations. I believe this experience is what Stefan has in mind. \r\n\r\nBut whether we're talking about implementations that have invented their own filter expression languages, or ones that have used JavaScript or Python or PHP for that, I don't know of any that treat the result of evaluating expressions starting with `@` in filters as a \"result list\". I don't think any of the important ones do. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I presume it should say the node sets produced by these selectors  are wrapped in JSON arrays, which sounds very much like automatically converting node sets into arrays.\r\n\r\n\"The object wildcard selector is wrapped in an array if the object has two or more members, otherwise a single value is returned.\" -- I presume you mean the node set produced by such a selector is wrapped (in a non-deterministic order?) in a JSON array if it has two or more members, that if the node set has a single value, this value is returned, and if the node set is empty, a null value is returned. (The conditional behaviour in this case is intriguing: if there is a single value in the node set which is an array, that array will be returned and there is nothing to distinguish the return value from an array produced from a node set with two or more members.)\r\n\r\nAlso, the paragraph doesn't say what happens to intermediate node sets. For instance, take the expression `@[*].foo` where `@` is an array. According to the paragraph `@[*]` returns an array (rather than a node set), but then I'm not sure what it means to apply the selector `.foo` to an array. I think the intention is to talk about \"final\" node sets. But in that case, it's impossible to distinguish the various cases unless we take into account the _last_ selector in the path. But that doesn't make much sense in cases like `@[*].foo` which would then always produce a single value.\r\n\r\n",

              "body": "> I find this paragraph confusing.\r\n> \r\n> \"The slice, recursive descent and union selectors, which can evaluate to zero, one, or many items, are wrapped in a Json array. \" -- I don't know what it means to wrap a selector in a JSON array. I presume it should say the node sets produced by these selectors are wrapped in JSON arrays, which sounds very much like automatically converting node sets into arrays.\r\n> \r\n> \"The object wildcard selector is wrapped in an array if the object has two or more members, otherwise a single value is returned.\" -- I presume you mean the node set produced by such a selector is wrapped (in a non-deterministic order?) in a JSON array if it has two or more members, that if the node set has a single value, this value is returned, and if the node set is empty, a null value is returned. (The conditional behaviour in this case is intriguing: if there is a single value in the node set which is an array, that array will be returned and there is nothing to distinguish the return value from an array produced from a node set with two or more members.)\r\n\r\nJayway's query function provides options to evaluate a JSONPath expression either as a result list or as a single value, the user can choose. Within filter expressions, though, an embedded JSONPath expression is always evaluated as a single value. For evaluating a JSONPath expression as a single value, the basic idea is that a selector that returns at most one value returns either that value or a JSON null (if none), and a selector that potentially can return zero or many values returns them as an array (rather than appending them to a result list). This isn't particularly well documented, but if you find my explanation unclear, you can refer to [JSONPath Reference](https://support.smartbear.com/readyapi/docs/testing/jsonpath-reference.html), the section on \"Usage notes and considerations.\" Or if you're familiar with JMESPath, it's similar to how JMESPath evaluates expressions.\r\n\r\nMy main point though is as follows. \r\n\r\nCurrently in the grammar, you have, for filter selectors\r\n```\r\npath         = rel-path / json-path\r\nrel-path     = \"@\" *(S (dot-selector / index-selector))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you allow a `json-path` in an expression, I think you, like Jayway and other implementations, have to answer the question: how do I evaluate the `json-path` as a single value? And if you answer that question (your answer may be different than Jayway's), why limit `rel-path`? Why not let expressions beginning with `@` be full JSONPath expressions in their own right, like they are in Jayway (and other implementations that invented their own expression language)? Why not allow JSONPath expressions to begin with either `$` or `@`, as Jayway does, and Bettio  proposed? This is eminently doable, there is proven prior experience.\r\n\r\nOr, if you prefer the simplicity of limiting expressions beginning with `@` to \r\n```\r\n\"@\" *(S (dot-selector / index-selector))\r\n```\r\nwhich is consistent with the implementations that dovetail on JavaScript, Python and PHP, why not interpret them in the same way as JavaScript, Python, and PHP do? As evaluating a variable `@` against identifier and index operators, which always return a single value? Where they are most emphatically _not_ JSONPath expressions, \"singular\" or otherwise?  Why not just drop `json-path` from the allowed elements in filters, so you don't have to tackle the problem of how to evaluate a JSONPath expression as a single value at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
